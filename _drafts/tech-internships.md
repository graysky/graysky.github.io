This week I went to my [alma mater](http://www.tufts.edu) to recruit at a career fair and talked to a lot of students about 
engineering internships at a tech company. Many students were trying to understand how to make the leap from
student to getting started in the working world. I remember when I was an undergrad how confusing the whole process
seemed - I knew I wanted to work at a software company but wasn't really sure how to make it happen. I stumbled 
into a few good ones where I learned a lot but I wanted to share a few suggestions to the undergrad who is trying
to land their first tech internship.

### 1. Find an Interesting Company

Lots of companies hire interns. Some have formal programs, some do it more casually and others might take
someone if they present themselves. Often bigger companies tend to have more a formal process and come
to recruiting events on campus. Smaller companies may rely on referrals to find theirs. Google is your friend -
