title: The Blog Timestamp is Dying

More often blogs and content sites are de-emphasizing the temporal nature of what they publish. In broad terms they are moving to be a collection of published articles, and publishing timely content on social networks.

Winer's [original definition](http://blogs.law.harvard.edu/whatmakesaweblogaweblog.html) of weblogging was:
> "A weblog is a hierarchy of text, images, media objects and data, arranged chronologically, that can be viewed in an HTML browser."

Primarily being "arranged chronologically" is becoming less important. Sites like [Medium](https://medium.com/) or corporate blogs like [KISSMetrics](http://blog.kissmetrics.com/saasy-pricing-strategies/) or [Intercom](http://insideintercom.io/the-dribbblisation-of-design/) make the timestamp less obvious. It isn't in the URL, nor often prominent on the page. I believe this is happening for several reasons:

- [RSS is dying](http://andrewchen.co/2013/04/29/the-death-of-rss-in-a-single-graph/). People no longer re-visit sites frequently to check for what is new, nor have robots do that work for them. They are discovering content in different ways, primarily through social networks, and coming in the sidedoor of sites.

- Social networks have won the war for short-form, timely content. Those micro-blogging platforms are (largely) time-ordered and that is what people chose to publish there.

- Downplaying the timestamp attempts to make the content appear more evergreen. There is often an (unfortunate) positive association with being "new", over being relevant or valuable. 

This gives those platforms an opportunity to better arrange their content. Perhaps it better in categories, dynamically suggested based on the content, or personalized based on the reader. The criteria should be about relevance and quality, not just freshness.

As a thought exercise I have long wondered why media publications have not built such a system to tailor my reading experience. Instead they have largely continued to ape their printed roots in their digital products. For example, I subscribe to the New Yorker in both magazine and iPad form. They present the list of current articles each issue. It would be better if they learned that I will read any Atul Gawande or [George Packer](http://graysky.org/2013/08/george-packer-the-unwinding/) article, and would want them to alert me if I missed one. While some of the magazine's coverage is time-sensitive (e.g. unfolding events in Syria) much of it is not. Despite my years of reading and expressing preferences the New York Times or Boston Globe has learned very little about me. I have a small hope that Jeff Bezos will bring some of the Amazon's personalization to the Washington Post.
