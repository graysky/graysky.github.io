<a href="http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=6524743">Ed Burns on Fresh Air discussing 'The Wire'</a>. I've begun to annoy family and friends who haven't watched <a href="http://www.hbo.com/thewire/">The Wire</a> because I keep imploring them to watch. Like right now, get the DVDs. I envy those that have 4 unwatched seasons ahead of them.
