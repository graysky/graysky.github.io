Recently returned from a week in Alaska (with <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/downtree/sets/72157594346580665/">some photos</a>). Had a great time and wasn't eaten by bears when camping in the backcountry of <a href="http://www.nps.gov/dena/">Denali</a>. On the plane there (and back again) I was reading <i><a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0618002243/mikechampion">Return of the King</a></i> which fit the mood well.
