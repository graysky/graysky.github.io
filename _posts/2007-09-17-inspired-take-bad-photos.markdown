This is the best photography insight I've read in a while (<a href="http://duncandavidson.com/archives/583">via</a>): <a href="http://blogs.adobe.com/jnack/2007/08/most_of_your_pi.html">"Most of your photos suck"</a>. Very refreshing to realize that the goal isn't nothing but good shots, but to go from 99.8% to like 98% suckage (in my case, anyway). Also makes it easier to throw away the ones that didn't work and appreciate the <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/downtree/sets/72157600504760222/">photos I'm actually happy with</a>, like the one above from a party this weekend.
