Just in time for Halloween, <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2003/TECH/space/10/30/solar.storm/index.html">a second solar storm</a> produced some colorful effects for those in the right spot to watch them. Which didn't include me because I was too near the city seeing <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0327056/">Mystic River</a>, so I  borrowed this photo.
