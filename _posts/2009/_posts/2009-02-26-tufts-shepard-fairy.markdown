We recently went to the <a href="http://www.icaboston.org/">Institute of Contemporary Art</a> to see the <a href="http://obeygiant.com/">Shepard Fairy</a> exhibit, "Supply & Demand". He is best known for his iconic <a href="http://obeygiant.com/headlines/obama">Obama "Hope"</a> image, and made headlines for being <a href="http://www.boston.com/news/local/massachusetts/articles/2009/02/07/obama_hope_poster_artist_arrested_in_boston/">arrested by the Boston police for vandalism warrants</a>. I'd been aware of some of his work - the "Andre Has a Posse", the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mozilla">red Mozilla.org dinosaur logo</a> -- but didn't know they were from one artist.

I've found I really like the borrowed style of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constructivism_(art)">Constructivist</a> and propaganda art, and Fairey nails that. In particular, there is one room of the exhibit that features several huge paintings & a wall of smaller works that was amazing. That alone made the visit it worth it (plus I like the ICA building itself.) The exhibit also features a series of portraits that were not as engaging, except for the striking Obama portrait. Overall, I agreed with <a href="http://www.newyorker.com/arts/critics/artworld/2009/02/23/090223craw_artworld_schjeldahl?printable=true">recent New Yorker review</a> that salutes his design more than a unifying message of the work. (Also, my inner-Holden-Caulfield gets triggered when I'm looking at capitalist-questioning art that certainly sells for a lot and that everyone has paid at least $12 to see. Or that it is street art that was often put up without permission but now has large signs next to it forbidding photography of it.)

Fairey has <a href="http://www.tuftsdaily.com/popular_artist_creates_mural_on_campus">installed several murals around Boston</a>, including at Tufts University. I took a trip over to Somerville to my old stomping grounds to take a few shots of it.
