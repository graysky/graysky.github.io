The best addition to my morning commute is driving past <a href="http://www.communityrowing.org/">Community Rowing Inc.'s</a> Harry Parker Boathouse along the Charles River in Brighton, MA. The <a href="http://www.gocrimson.com/ViewArticle.dbml?DB_OEM_ID=9000&ATCLID=1580207">$15 million dollar, 30,000 sq. ft.</a> boathouse was designed by <a href="http://www.anmahian-winton.com">Anmahian Winton Architects</a> to support public access to rowing. The choice of material and cross-hatching pattern for the exterior add to the striking yet inviting feel of the structure.
