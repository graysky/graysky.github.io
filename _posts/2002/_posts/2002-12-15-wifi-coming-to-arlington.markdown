<a href="http://radio.weblogs.com/0107057/2002/12/12.html">From this posting</a>, it appears that WiFi connectivity is <a href="http://www.arlingtonwireless.org">coming to Arlington</a>, which is where I live. I guess we are part of the <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2002/12/12/technology/circuits/12wifi.html">"WiFi Boom"</a>, spreading from the <a href="http://bostonwireless.org">bigger cities like Boston</a> toward the suburbs.

So now all I need is a <a href="http://www-132.ibm.com/webapp/wcs/stores/servlet/CategoryDisplay?storeId=1&catalogId=-840&langId=-1&categoryId=2035724">wireless notebook </a> that will let me take advantage of these <a href="http://www.wifimaps.com">countless local hotspots</a>.
