Just testing out this new(est) blog-fangled technology. 

I've played around with making a "news" site (before the term blog came into vogue) for years, but I never end up sticking with it. I realize I have nothing to say and quit. But then get pulled in again to try out some <a href="http://www.blogger.com">new technology</a>. This time it is <a href="http://www.movabletype.org">Movable Type</a>. So far it has been easy to use, and a little prettier than blogger. But even when it was my own little Perl or PHP scripts, it was never the technology that stopped me - it was the audience. Who is this for? Me? If so, why would I put it here. Friends & family maybe, but putting things on the web leaves it for anyone to read. Hmm...

So I had to think of an obnoxious little name for this weblog. It may stay, it might not. This whole project might get deleted in a moment of disgust at the self-indulgent world of weblogs. But maybe, just maybe, I will think of something to actually put up here...
