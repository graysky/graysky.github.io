The new <a href="http://www.okkervilriver.com/">Okkervil River</a> album, "The Stage Names", is <a href="http://www.myspace.com/okkervilriver">available on their MySpace page</a>. The latest from the Austin-based band (although <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Okkervil_River">originally from New Hampshire</a>)</a> has been getting <a href="http://www.pitchforkmedia.com/article/record_review/44665-the-stage-names">positive reviews</a>. At their best on tracks like "Our Life is Not a Movie Or Maybe" or "Plus Ones" everything leans forward so far to be pleasantly off-balance. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Will_Sheff">Will Sherff's great lyrics</a> are dense enough to sink in mercury. The album is more solid than last year's "Overboard & Down" EP, which featured the stand out <a href="http://youtube.com/watch?v=VQaBxJiAjPE">"The President's Dead"</a>.
