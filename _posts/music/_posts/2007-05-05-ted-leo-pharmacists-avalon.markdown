<a href="http://www.tedleo.com/">Ted Leo and the Pharmacists</a> played at <a href="http://tourb.us/show/25948-Ted_Leo_and_the_Pharmacists-Love_Of_Diagrams-Avalon-Boston-MA">Avalon last night</a>. Having never seen Mr Leo perform, I wasn't sure what to expect. He certainly delivers a tight, energetic show. They opened with "Sons of Cain" off their new album, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B000MQ55DO/ref=nosim?tag=mikechampion">Living With The Living</a> and hardly took a breath for half the set. <a href="http://exitfare.blogspot.com/2007/05/ted-leo-and-pharmacists.html">The full crowd</a> liked the mix of songs from the new album and older ones, that included a few from my favorite Ted Leo album, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00005KAON/ref=nosim?tag=mikechampion">The Tyranny of Distance</a>. Although for my money the best song of the night might have been <a href="http://www.last.fm/music/Ted+Leo+and+The+Pharmacists/_/The+High+Party">"The High Party"</a>.
