It looks like my employer has taken the leap into <a href="http://www-128.ibm.com/developerworks/blogs/dw_blog_comments.jspa?blog=351&entry=81328">encouraging employee blogs</a>. The guidelines they posted seem rather reasonable as they follow <a href="http://blogs.sun.com">Sun</a> and <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/">Microsoft</a> into the blogosphere. At least at the moment they haven't built their own blogging tools (other than <a href="http://www-128.ibm.com/developerworks/blogs/">developerWorks blogs</a>), and suggest using popular tools like Blogger or LiveJournal (ha!). I hope IBM at least comes up with an feed aggregator/blog roller so people can easily see who the IBM bloggers are. How else will we find our <a href="http://blogs.sun.com/jonathan">Jonathan Schwartz</a> or <a href="http://scoble.weblogs.com/">Scoble</a>? Coming on the same day as IBM announces it's <a href="http://www.informationweek.com/story/showArticle.jhtml?articleID=163101894">internal support for FireFox</a> and I'm impressed with Big Blue's progressiveness.

Since I like to think of myself as a good IBMer, I'll follow their advice to "be who you are", so ... I'm a developer on <a href="http://www-306.ibm.com/software/awdtools/clearcase/">Rational ClearCase</a>, specifically on the <a href="http://eclipse.org">Eclipse</a>-based <a href="http://www3.software.ibm.com/ibmdl/pub/software/rationalsdp/clearcase/ccrc/614/update/support/">Remote Client</a>. Just from the number of folks out there starting to make bug trackers, I can tell there are a lot of developers who'd like to make software tools. And I know why, software tools is an exciting niche to work in! At least among developers - I just get looks when I try to explain it to normal folks.

PS - I'm supposed to add, "The postings on this site are my own and don't necessarily represent IBM's positions, strategies or opinions." Just in case you were confused.
