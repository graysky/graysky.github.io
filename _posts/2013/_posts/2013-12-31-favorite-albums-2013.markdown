The yearly new album roundup is part of the <a href="/2012/12/favorite-albums-2012/">one consistent theme</a> on this blog. The following are the albums I listened to most in 2013. I made a <a href="http://rd.io/x/QVaELTMq3Ck/">Rdio playlist of selected songs</a> from them as well.

Like 2012 I purchased zero albums and listened almost entirely via Rdio (and sometimes in Spotify "private" mode when too embarrassed to share a pop obsession). We added a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00EWCUK1Q/?tag=mikechampion">Sonos Play 1</a> to the mix at home since 95% of the music I listen to is in the cloud, although I still drag around a giant iTunes library.

**10.** Drake, <a href="http://rd.io/x/QVaELSJr9xY/"><em>Nothing Was the Same</em></a> - This one grew on me, not as much as "Take Care" but still found myself listening to it a lot. I appreciate that his sound is different than a lot of other hip hop.

**9.** The National, <a href="http://rd.io/x/QVaELSJxFAY/"><em>Trouble Will Find Me</em></a> - I think they are at their best when they have different dynamics in the same song, like on the great "Demons". Found this a solid album for driving-and-thinking (and maybe <a href="https://twitter.com/babychamps/status/402127805779279872">trying to lull the kid to sleep</a> too).

**8.** Ra Ra Riot, <a href="http://rd.io/x/QVaELSJ-LGQ/"><em>Beta Love</em></a> - I got into this late in the year but was hooked by the pop/dance infectiousness. The title track is uber-catchy.

**7.** Jay Z, <a href="http://rd.io/x/QVaELSJuSpI/"><em>Magna Carta...Holy Grail</em></a> - While he doesn't have a struggle to rail against and has supremely made it, still highly entertaining on tracks like "f*ckwithmeyouknowigotit". Also, the "Legends of the Summer" concert was great and <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/downtree/9489070839/">by far the largest show I've seen</a>.

**6.** Daft Punk, <a href="http://rd.io/x/QVaELSJy0K8/"><em>Random Access Memories</em></a> - I listened to this album enough to make myself slightly sick of it but "Instant Crush" and "Doin' It Right" were on repeat for a long time. 

**5.** Haim, <a href="http://rd.io/x/QVaELSJrshY/"><em>Days Are Gone</em></a> - Apparently it was a good year for me liking girl bands. This album feels like a more rocking version of Tegan & Sara on tracks like "Falling", which is a-ok by me.

**4.** CHVRCHES, <a href="http://rd.io/x/QVaELSJr430/"><em>The Bones of What You Believe</em></a> - Great rock album with an interesting synth sound. The song "Lies" was the standout track for me, and in my head for days.

**3.** Pusha T, <a href="http://rd.io/x/QVaELSJq_jo/"><em>My Name is My Name</em></a> - Having really liked him as part of Clipse and on "New God Flow" I liked the diversity of great tracks on the album. "Numbers on the Board" and "Nosetalgia" are highlights, especially Kendrick Lamar's contribution on the latter.

**2.** Lorde, <a href="http://rd.io/x/QVaELSJrF2o/"><em>Pure Heroine</em></a> - An enormous amount has already been written about Lorde and rightly so. "Royals" is fantastic and the rest of the album impressively lives up to it.

**1.** Vampire Weekend, <a href="http://rd.io/x/QVaELSJxFAo/"><em>Modern Vampires of the City</em></a> - I loved this album, and feels like their best to date. I really liked "Graceland" as a kid and this has a modern take on what I loved about that.
