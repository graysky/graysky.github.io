<a href="http://www.tivolovers.com/a-review-of-the-tivo-hd-digital-media-recorder/">The TiVo Lovers blog has a review of the $300 TiVo HD, the previously rumored "Series 3 Lite".</a> Even though I love my <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B000I661J0/ref=nosim?tag=mikechampion">TiVo Series3</a> as the beautiful, life-changing device that it is, the $300 less TiVo HD looks like the better deal now. Still dual-tuner, records HD and great interface with only a smaller hard drive (160GB vs. 250GB), a non-backlit remote and no OLEDs. The <a href="http://gizmodo.com/gadgets/home-entertainment/tivo-on-comcast-how-it-works-228822.php">TiVo on Comcast DVR</a> is also worth comparing depending on cable providers and budget.

<b>Update:</b> <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B000RZDBM2/ref=nosim?tag=mikechampion">Amazon now has the TiVo TCD652160 HD DVR</a> available for pre-order, becoming available on August 25th.
