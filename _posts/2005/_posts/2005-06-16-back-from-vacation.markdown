Back from a week's vacation on Martha's Vineyard, just missing the end of <a href="http://www.jawsfest.com/">JawsFest</a>. No coding, just relaxation and good food. We went for a birthday dinner at a nice place in Edgartown called "Atria". The restaurant shares the name of the original company my co-workers started to develop <a href="http://www-306.ibm.com/software/awdtools/clearcase/">ClearCase</a> (before the many acquisitions). But the waitress pronounced the word differently, and said it was named for a star in a constellation. I'd only known it was the plural of "atrium". Turns out <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atria">we're both right</a>.
