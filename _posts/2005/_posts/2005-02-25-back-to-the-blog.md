Haven't posted anything in a long, long time but I'm aiming to get back into the routine. In my absence this site has been getting <i>absolutely hammered</i> with comment spam. It isn't visible on the site, but once the spammers learn the right URL, they just don't let go. And being as lazy as I am, I didn't get around to fix it till just now.

Recently I took a pass through a couple different blogging tools in hope of finding one that I like better than <a href="http://www.movabletype.org/">MovableType</a>. Nothing quite does it all - <a href="http://wordpress.org/">Wordpress</a>, <a href="http://blojsom.sf.net/">Blojsom</a>, and <a href="http://www.jroller.com/">JRoller</a> each have some features better than each other, but have some fatal flaw for my usage. Wordpress has a slick editing UI, but it should it make it easier to have multiple blogs out of a single installation. Blojsom is solid, but my hosting doesn't support servlets. And I can't bring myself to spending hours editing tons of scripts to get the layout and form  the way I want it. A UI for design like <a href="http://www.typepad.com/">TypePad</a> would be better, but without paying anything. Although at this point, most people likely read blogs through RSS so it probably doesn't matter what the site actually looks like.
