I spent a rainy Saturday with a few hundred other nerds at a one day <a href="http://startupschool.org">"Startup School"</a> here in Cambridge. There was a fast-paced series of <a href="http://startupschool.infogami.com/Presentations">interesting talks</a> on various aspects of starting a company. I won't try to recreate <a href="http://startupschool.infogami.com/Blog_Coverage">the notes that many others</a> were dutifully taking (mostly on their Apple laptops). Beyond the talks themselves, I really enjoyed hanging out with those who came from far and wide to attend. It's rare to meet so many people who share a common interest in technology, and they created a very exciting atmosphere to be in. Big thanks to the <a href="http://www.ycombinator.com">Y Combinator</a> folks for putting the event together, and for their open house on Sunday.
