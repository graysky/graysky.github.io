This is enough to make me not want to go outside. And May is usually the nicest month in Boston! But I'm glad I braved the incliment weather last night to head to the <a href="http://java.meetup.com/10/">Boston Java meetup</a> to hear a presentation from <a href="http://www.jroller.com/page/cpurdy">Cameron</a> at <a href="http://www.tangosol.com">Tangosol</a> on their "world's most expensive hashmap".
