A tour of the former Vanderbilt summer cottage <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Breakers">The Breakers</a> in Newport, RI convinced me that I'd much prefer having internet access, HDTV and cures for childhood diseases than all the marble bathtubs and fireplaces a 19th century railroad fortune could buy.
