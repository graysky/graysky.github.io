I'm excited to share <a href="http://forcerank.it">ForceRank</a>, an app to make
group decisions simpler. Think of it like "<a href="http://doodle.com/">doodle</a> for priority setting." It aims to avoid the pain of spending too much time in a meeting hashing out what is the next important thing to do. Built by <a href="https://twitter.com/jdwyah">Jeff Dwyer</a> and myself, more details can be found on the <a href="http://blog.forcerank.it/introducing-forcerank">launch post</a>.

Personally I'm interested in the emergence of lightweight, team interaction tools, such as <a href="http://www.15five.com/">15five</a> or <a href="https://www.tinypulse.com/">Tinypulse</a>. They are typically asynchronous and seek to compliment existing processes rather than entirely replace them. For example, 15five has led to much higher quality one-on-ones in my experience to date. (And certainly the rise of distributed teams increases the need for better alternatives to more meetings.) My hope is that <a href="http://forcerank.it">ForceRank</a> saves people time and makes their teams a little more efficient. As software-eats-the-world it would be a worthwhile life's mission to rescue people from dreadful, poorly run meetings.
