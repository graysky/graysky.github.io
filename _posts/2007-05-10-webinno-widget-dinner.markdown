Last night I went to the first <a href="http://www.webinnovatorsgroup.com/">Boston Web Innovators</a> dinner, focused on the topic of widgets. The event was organized by <a href="http://www.genuinevc.com">David Beisel</a> and held at the Cambridge offices of <a href="http://www.venrock.com">Venrock</a>. The <a href="http://www.webinnovatorsgroup.com/blog/2007/04/03/first-webinno-dinner-group-%e2%80%93-widgets-and-advertising/">concept of the evening</a> was to pick a theme for discussion and have a smaller gathering (10-15) than at the normal WebInno demo & networking events, which have grown quite large. Among those in attendance there seemed to be a range of familiarity with widgets; including those actively building and marketing them, to those trying to understand how to market and monetize them, or just wondering if <a href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/16329739/site/newsweek/">2007 will be the year of the widget</a>. A few highlights and thoughts:

<ul>
<li>David Cutler of <a href="http://www.oddcast.com">Oddcast</a> gave a short overview of widgets and talked about a few successful widgets like <a href="http://www.southwest.com/ding/">Southwest Airlines' Ding!</a>. As with many new technologies, the terminology can be a little confusing. There are <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Widget">web, desktop and mobile widgets</a>, other terms like badges, and an array of technologies to build them. Jon from <a href="http://www.guildcafe.com">GuildCafe</a> shared some his experiences in building widgets.

<li>There was some discussion about how to monetize them. Jon expressed skepticism (and I agree) about whether embedding advertising would turn off many potential users. Although, as was mentioned, there are services like <a href="http://www.weatherbug.com">WeatherBug</a> that are ad supported. I'd venture that there is a difference between ads shown only to me versus ads that run on a public facing page or social network profile. At a minimum the ads would have to be well targeted, or slide into the content like an intro ad to a video.

<li>Widgets on the web further complicate how to measure and analyze traffic. Fred Wilson blogged about the <a href="http://avc.blogs.com/a_vc/2007/05/over_counting_w.html">topic today on overcounting widget hits</a>. For example, we've built <a href="http://tourb.us/badge">badges for tourb.us</a> that allow fans or bands to list their upcoming shows on their blogs or sites, and for a while even Fred ran it on his badge-covered blog (when it was sporting even more bling). We served a lot of badge "views" but certainly those hits aren't equal to a view on our site directly. Is there a reasonable way to discount those views? On some sites the widget may be front and center, and on others buried among many others. 

<li>After discussion by the full table it broke into more informal conversations. Always interesting since the WebInno events draw a bright crowd, but most of my chatting wasn't about widgets per se, other than some thoughts on <a href="http://labs.adobe.com/technologies/apollo/">Apollo</a>, <a href="http://silverlight.net/">Silverlight</a> and what to make of <a href="http://www.sun.com/software/javafx/">JavaFX</a>.
</ul>
