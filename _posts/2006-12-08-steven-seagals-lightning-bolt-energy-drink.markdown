This is the first Gmail ad I think I've clicked on. I don't know what my email was about that Google decided the best ad to run was for this:

<blockquote>
Steven Seagal's Energy Drink
Taste the Power of Steven Seagal
</blockquote>

If this product wasn't out of stock, everyone on my Christmas shopping list would be getting <a href="http://www.xoxide.com/lightning-bolt-asian-experiance.html">"Lightning Bolt, the one and only energy drink crafted by martial arts expert and herbal specialist Steven Seagal, is the only all natural 100% juice energy drink on the market"</a>. Unfortunately it must be quite popular (since it is the <em>only</em> one that Steven Seagal would craft.)
