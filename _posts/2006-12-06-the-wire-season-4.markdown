We finished watching Season 4 of The Wire on Monday night. Video On Demand is great when they release the episodes a week early, which almost makes up for the 20 minutes I spent navigating through RCN's painfully slow menus again and again after hitting errors telling me to "try again momentarily".

Like other seasons this one had a slow buildup leading to exciting final few episodes. I'm very glad to see that despite its modest ratings that it has been <a href="http://www.variety.com/article/VR1117949949.html?categoryid=1417&amp;cs=1&amp;s=h&amp;p=0">renewed for a fifth and final season</a>. Throughout this season I was struck by quality of the acting from the teenage cast members, especially the four central boys and "Snoop". Watching Michael grow up to join Marlo had me thinking that George Lucas could have learned from this season how to take a sympathetic character and turn him into a villian.
