The new <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Panda_Bear_%28musician%29">Panda Bear</a> album, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B000NA27TE/ref=nosim?tag=mikechampion">"Person Pitch"</a> should herald Spring, depsite the cold and wet that remains in the Northeast. Perhaps it is the vocals that evoke Brian Wilson, the Beach Boys and their California vibe that make it feel so sunny. The repetition of vocal parts and layers of samples provide more atmosphere than a sharp center. The wide variety of sounds fit well together, except for a door bell on "Take Pills" that has me sitting up like a cat who notices a dog on tv. The experiment <a href="http://www.pitchforkmedia.com/article/record_review/41826-person-pitch">works</a> especially on "Take Pills" and "Bros". <a href="http://www.myspace.com/rippityrippity">Three shows</a> hardly counts as a tour, which is fitting as the music hardly wants to call attention to itself.
