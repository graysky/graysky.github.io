<a href="http://stereogum.com/okx/">Stereogum pulled together a tribute</a> to the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ok_Computer">10 year old Radiohead classic "Ok Computer"</a>. I'm not feeling it. Perhaps it is just an impossibly high bar. But songs like the Cold War Kids covering "Electioneering" miss all the energy (and cowbell) of the original. And I just feel bad for Samson Dalonoga asked to cover "Fitter Happier".
