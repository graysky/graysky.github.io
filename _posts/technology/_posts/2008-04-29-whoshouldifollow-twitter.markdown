Today we're launching <a href="http://whoshouldifollow.com">WhoShouldiFollow</a>, a <a href="http://twitter.com">Twitter</a> friend recommendation engine. The goal is to let you know who you should be following. <a href="http://whoshouldifollow.com">WhoShouldiFollow</a> finds interesting people to follow based on who your friends are, and who they follow. It supports finding other twitter users near a specific location, and adjusting recommendations for popular people (since not everyone needs to follow <a href="http://twitter.com/Scobleizer">Scobleizer</a>). 

I worked with <a href="http://twitter.com/gary">Gary</a>, who did the heavy lifting on the collaborative filtering, to build this small contribution to the growing number of <a href="http://twitter.pbwiki.com/">twitter apps</a> out there. Feedback welcome via <a href="http://twitter.com/wsif">@wsif</a>. Enjoy!
