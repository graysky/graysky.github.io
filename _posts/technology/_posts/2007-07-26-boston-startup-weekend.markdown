<a href="http://boston.startupweekend.com/">The Startup Weekend series is coming to Boston the weekend of October 18-21st.</a> This experiment <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2007/07/07/startupweekend-70-founders-create-company-in-one-weekend/">was previously run in Boulder</a>, which produced <a href="http://vosnap.com/">vosnap</a>, a "social quick voting tool". <a href="http://www.uncov.com/2007/7/10/vosnap-an-overnight-delivery-of-fail">Not convinced</a> this is a great way to start a company, but could be an interesting hacking weekend.
