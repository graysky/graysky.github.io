It has come to my attention that when <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=mike+champion">googling Mike Champion</a> the first hit will be this other <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/mikechampion/">Mike Champion</a> who works at Microsoft <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/mikechampion/archive/2007/05/01/reporting-for-duty-on-ws-deathstar.aspx">aboard the WS-Deathstar</a>. Blog posts with titles like <a href="http://www.25hoursaday.com/weblog/PermaLink.aspx?guid=2de82d9a-7e46-4cb2-a787-3786e67e1780">"Mike Champion Defends WS-*"</a> send shivers down my spine, so I thought I'd clarify that I'm in the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_State_Transfer">RESTful camp</a>. 

Seeing DHH give his keynote at last year's <a href="http://www.railsconf.org">RailsConf</a> on <a href="http://bloggingrailsconf.com/articles/2006/06/25/david-heinemeier-hansson-keynote">ActiveResource</a> was eye-opening to a simple path to web services. I still have scars from trying to get a very early version of <a href="http://ws.apache.org/axis/">Apache Axis</a> to generate WSDL that MS tools would consume. And the recent book <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/0596529260/ref=nosim?tag=mikechampion">"RESTful Web Services"</a> by Leonard Richardson and Sam Ruby is chock full of pragmatic REST goodness. Just wanted to set the record straight.
