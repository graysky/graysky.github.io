<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2007/07/24/technology/24cnd-phone.html">AT&T signed up 146,000 iPhone customers in the 1st quarter</a>, far short of the <a href="http://www.engadget.com/2007/07/02/500-000-iphones-sold-so-far-but-can-apple-keep-up/">500,000 units that some were estimating around the launch</a>. The pricetag is quite high for a mobile phone, and even potential buyers like myself are waiting for the next generation. Analysts compare it with the launch of the iPod, which also didn't initially match the hype but seems to have worked out okay for Apple.
