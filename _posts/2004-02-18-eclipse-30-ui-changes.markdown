I've been using Eclipse 3.0M7 and like some of the new features (RCP, smarter editor, etc.) and concurrency improvements. But I'm afraid of the new UI changes coming in M8 (along with <a href="https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=37997">many other people</a>). Maybe there is something I'm missing, but having Eclipse look like a native app was always a huge plus in my mind. Usability improvements are one thing, but having funky colored buttons and sloped tabs don't do much for me. I think I'll follow the <a href="http://www.eclipsepowered.org/archives/000028.html">advice of EclipsePowered.org</a>
