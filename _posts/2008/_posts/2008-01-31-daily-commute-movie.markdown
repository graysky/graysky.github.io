With a jury-rigged <a href="http://graysky.org/2008/01/canon-powershot-g9/">Canon G9</a> on a Gorillapod poking through the moonroof I filmed a time lapse movie of <a href="http://youtube.com/watch?v=KHL2cVaFcqs">my daily commute</a>. I'd been looking for an excuse to try out the movie modes on the G9. The roughly 11 mile drive becomes 90 seconds of racing out of Watertown, through Fresh Pond in Cambridge and out Rt. 2 west to Rt. 128. And thankfully the camera stayed attached to the car for the whole trip!

(YouTube had problems with the original uploaded AVI, so I converted it to MPEG first. I'm not sure how YouTube converts to FLV, but the result is definitely more blurry than the source video.)
