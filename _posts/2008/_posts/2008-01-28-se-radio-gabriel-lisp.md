<a href="http://www.se-radio.net/">Software Engineering Radio</a> had <a href="http://www.dreamsongs.com/">Richard Gabriel</a>, of Lucid and <a href="http://www.dreamsongs.com/WorseIsBetter.html">"worse-is-better"</a> fame, on for a <a href="http://www.se-radio.net/podcast/2008-01/episode-84-dick-gabriel-lisp">chat about Lisp</a>. Gabriel provides a interesting, quick history of Lisp and some of the important concepts it introduced. Included some trivia I didn't know like <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Car_and_cdr">"car" and "cdr"</a> stand for "contents of address of register" and "contents of decrement of register", respectively. (So obvious for getting the first/rest elements of a list!) When asked about the state of Lisp in use today, he mentions some AI research, <a href="http://www.itasoftware.com/">ITA</a> and Yahoo Stores (Viaweb), which are the only ones I knew -- there must be more, right? Gabriel also talks a little bit about his MFA in poetry (a true code-poet!) and the study of software, which I wrote about <a href="http://graysky.org/2007/03/dreaming-in-code/">related to "Dreaming in Code"</a>.

Although sometimes the topics are too dry or enterprise-y for my taste, <a href="http://www.se-radio.net/">SE Radio</a> does a great job for a tech podcast. The interviewer is knowledgable, asks good questions and lets his guest speak, which is surprisingly rare.
