<a href="http://www.shirky.com/">Clay Shirky</a> spoke tonight at the Berkman Center about his <a href="http://www.boingboing.net/2008/02/28/clay-shirkys-masterp.html">just released book</a>, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/1594201536/mikechampion"><i>Here Comes Everyone</i></a>, and the power of group forming (<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_0FgRKsqqU">full video</a> and <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/downtree/sets/72157604004497866/">pics</a>). He discussed how the ease of online group forming affects sharing, conversation, collaboration and collective action. David Weinberger <a href="http://www.hyperorg.com/blogger/2008/02/28/clay-shirkys-book-talk/">took detailed notes of the talk</a>. Very interesting talk, and I liked his answer to my question about possible downsides (paraphrased):

<blockquote>A: I used to be a cyber-utopian. That view broke for me. I was teaching a class at NYU on social software. One of my students was a community manager for a magazine for teenage girls. They were shutting down the health and beauty boards because we can’t get the pro-anorexia girls to shut up with tips about how to avoid eating. I was thinking this isn’t a side effect of the Net. It was an effect. Ridiculously easy group forming for anorexics. Now, we have to move to a publish-then-filter world [filtering at the edges]. That pattern suggests we’re moving the media world from decision to reaction. We can’t stop the pro-anorexia groups from forming. All we can do is watch and act.

A. My nightmare is that the advertising budget for print shrinks and we lose newspapers in mid-size American cities. We lose investigative journalism [that blogging doesn't replace a city beat reporter]. Every city under a million goes back to endemic civic corruption. The newspaper industry is not ready now to talk about how to save investigative journalism as we lose print.</blockquote>

Shirky has a <a href="http://shirky.com/herecomeseverybody/">blog for his book</a> and has several <a href="http://itc.conversationsnetwork.org/shows/detail470.html">interesting podcast lectures out there</a>.
