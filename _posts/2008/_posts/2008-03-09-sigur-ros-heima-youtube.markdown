The Sigur RÃ³s concert film <a href="http://www.sigurros.com/"><i>Heima</i></a> is now <a href="http://youtube.com/watch?v=lr4s7KeCbV8">available on YouTube</a> (<a href="http://thephoenix.com/onthedownload/PermaLink.aspx?guid=2a59faaa-dc27-4ac9-8042-65681355e6b3">via</a>).   The film follows the band playing shows around their native Iceland in the summer of 2006. I caught the screening at the Kendall in Decemeber and was glad I saw it. The interviews were alright, but their music set to the beautiful cinematography was fantastic. They close the film with my favorite song of theirs, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B000W1VEQQ/ref=nosim?tag=mikechampion">"untitled #8"</a> from the untitled album <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B000W1YYRC/ref=nosim?tag=mikechampion"><i>()</i></a> (starts at 1:19), which always gives me chills.
