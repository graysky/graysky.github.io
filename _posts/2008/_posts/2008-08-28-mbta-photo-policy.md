Recently I was in South Boston to take pictures of the <a href="http://www.themacallenbuilding.com">Macallen condo building</a>. Directly across the street is (what I think is) an <a href="http://mbta.com">MBTA</a> bus depot, and I took a few photos in that direction to capture a rainbow that appeared after the rain. As I was leaving, an MBTA SUV pulled up with two people inside and asked me what newspaper I work for. I said the photos are for a photography class I'm taking. They responded quickly something about warning me that I wasn't allowed to take photos on or of MBTA property and drove off. It struck me as a little silly since Google provides <a href="http://is.gd/1frt">satellite imagery</a> and certainly a small camera could be more easily concealed than my bulky SLR. 

This left me wondering what the MBTA photography policy actually is. I remember two years back that there had been some <a href="http://www.boston.com/news/local/massachusetts/articles/2006/06/13/aclu_threatens_to_sue_over_limits_to_photographing_the_t/">protesting by the Mass. ACLU over the MBTA's photography ban</a> without a permit. For a while the <a href="http://transitpolice.us">T Transit Police</a> website had the policy available, but the site has since gone away (replaced with an early-90s-era "Under Construction" image). And while neither archive.org nor google had a copy, a kind netizen sent me a copy of the current <a href=" http://graysky.org/public/MBTA_Photo_Policy.pdf">MBTA photography policy</a> (pdf).

The policy seems pretty reasonable, although I'm not sure why tripods are thought to be so disruptive. Hopefully it will become more well-known among MBTA employees (still plenty of stories about getting yelled at for taking photos), or at least photographers can print out the MBTA's policy.
