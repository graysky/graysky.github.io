Today marks the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rational_Software">5 year anniversary of Rational Software being acquired by IBM</a> for $2.1B. Rational joined a company roughly 100 times as large (3,000 vs 300,000) and became the fifth <a href="http://www.ibm.com/software/">software "brand"</a> within Software Group. (Each brand has a color -- Rational is blue, WebSphere purple, Tivoli red, Lotus yellow, DB2 green -- which I can only assume was inspired by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voltron">Voltron</a>.)

I remember distinctly <a href="http://graysky.org/2002/12/ibm-acquires-rational/">waking up one day in December, 2002</a> to find out that Rational was being sold. It's been interesting to watch the process of becoming part of IBM, what has stayed the same and what has changed.
