The NYTimes and AIGA are sponsoring a <a href="http://pollingplaces.nytimes.com/">Polling Places Photo Project</a> as a "nationwide experiment in citizen journalism that encourages voters to capture, post and share photographs of this yearâ€™s primaries, caucuses and general election". <a href="http://pollingplaces.nytimes.com/content.cfm?page=photo_detail&voterID=1104254&photoID=3272809">I took a quick photo</a> on this rainy <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Tuesday">Super Tuesday</a> of where I voted in Watertown.

I've always liked the act of voting, and taking part in Americans gathering in school gyms and community centers to chose our civic leaders. This election is especially nice for a couple of reasons. This year I'm <a href="http://www.barackobama.com/">truly excited about a candidate</a>. (I feel like <a href="http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0018956/">Josh</a> in a scene from <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0200276/">The West Wing</a> when he comes back from NH wearing a giant smile to show <a href="http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0018943/">Sam</a> he's found "the real thing".) Next, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_election#Primary_systems_state-by-state">Massachusetts' semi-open primary</a> is on Super Tuesday, <a href="http://www.wbur.org/news/2008/74664_20080205.asp">increasing the amount of campaigning</a> here and drawing McCain, Obama and Clinton to speak in the state yesterday. Finally, having a (mostly) proportional assignment of delegates means that each vote counts, which is not always true in lopsided Mass. elections. 

Ok, go exercise your franchise and all that.
