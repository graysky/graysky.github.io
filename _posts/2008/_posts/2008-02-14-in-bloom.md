In an effort to try to get into the true spirit of Valentine's Day, I've been repeatedly listening to The Magnetic Fields <a href="http://youtube.com/watch?v=Pp5eBxU248Y">"I Don't Want to Get Over You"</a> from "69 Love Songs" (although I would have been fine with about 14). The Magnetic Fields are playing at the Somerville Theatre <a href="http://tourb.us/show/59843-The_Magnetic_Fields-Somerville_Theatre-Somerville-MA">tonight</a> & <a href="http://tourb.us/show/59850-The_Magnetic_Fields-Somerville_Theatre-Somerville-MA">tomorrow</a>.
