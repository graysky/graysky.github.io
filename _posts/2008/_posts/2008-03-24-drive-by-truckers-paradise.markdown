The <a href="http://www.drivebytruckers.com/">Drive-By Truckers</a> played a fantastic, sold-out show at <a href="http://tourb.us/show/59941-Drive-By_Truckers-The_Whigs-Paradise_Rock_Club-Boston-MA">the Paradise on Saturday</a>. A two hour set of their southern rock <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drive-by_truckers">"three axe attack"</a>, capped with a long encore, included a lot off <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B000ZKRFDA/ref=nosim?tag=mikechampion"><i>Brighter Than Creation's Dark</i></a> like the great "Righteous Path" and some older ones like "Sink Hole", "Hell No, I Ain't Happy", "Marry Me" and "Let There Be Rock". It was enough to restore the <a href="http://www.boston.com/ae/music/articles/2008/03/24/over_the_long_haul_these_truckers_deliver/">Globe's faith in rock n' roll</a>, complete with drinking Jack Daniel's on stage and smoking despite Boston's ban (which passes for modern day rebellion). And I heard a less cleaned-up version of what the <a href="http://www.bostonherald.com/entertainment/music/general/view.bg?articleid=1082345">Herald quotes Cooley</a> as saying, 

<blockquote>"Or you can just burn it [their new album] for all your friends...Hell, we donâ€™t care."</blockquote>

The crowd loved it all -- singing along while throwing up the devil horns and spilling drinks.
