They say <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/You_Can%27t_Go_Home_Again">you can't go home again</a>, but I'm pretty sure you can, especially if free food is involved. On a recent trip home I <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/downtree/archives/date-taken/2008/06/14/">took a few photos around the elementary school</a> I attended. Walking around what once was my entire world, now it felt small and different. Even an <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/downtree/2579132642/">old, favorite climbing tree</a> had lost its magic. It was a late-20s, <a href="http://www.zachbraff.com">Zach-Braff</a> sort of moment.
