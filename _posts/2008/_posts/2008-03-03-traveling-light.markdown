In the past I'd been a skeptic of converging functions (email, web, mp3 player, etc.) on a mobile phone. I thought it would end up with a device that did nothing well. I was wrong. 

This weekend we made a short trip to Philly (<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/downtree/sets/72157604030379895/">photos</a>) and the iPhone was a perfect companion for traveling light. Email, SMS, phone, music, web, of course. I watched <em><a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0478134/">In the Valley of Elah</a></em> on the plane and was impressed (despite <a href="http://arstechnica.com/journals/apple.ars/2008/01/25/review-of-itunes-movie-rentals-what-you-need-to-know">lame 24hr DRM rule</a>), listened to part of <em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/0312427654/mikechampion">Better</a></em> on audiobook, used the "Locate Me" plus Google Maps directions (our rental car didn't have GPS). The camera is okay, but I tend to mainly use it if there is something to quickly capture and share (instead <a href="http://graysky.org/2008/01/canon-powershot-g9/">the G9</a> came along this trip). Now if it could just print boarding passes.
