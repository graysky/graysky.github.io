We've been watching and greatly enjoying the <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0472027/"><i>John Adams</i> mini-series</a>, which prompted me to finally photograph the Captain William Smith House along the Battle Road in the <a href="http://www.nps.gov/mima/">Minute Man National Historic Park</a>. I've always liked where it sits, and was looking for a subject to experiment with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_dynamic_range_imaging">HDR</a> techniques.
