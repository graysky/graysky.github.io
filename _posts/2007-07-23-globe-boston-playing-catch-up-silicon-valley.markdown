<a href="http://www.boston.com/business/technology/articles/2007/07/22/will_boston_ever_catch_up/">Scott Kirsner writes in the Globe that Boston is behind Silicon Valley in consumer tech.</a> No surprises here on East Coast vs. West Coast / infrastructure vs. consumer split.   Kirsner ends saying that he thinks the Boston consumer tech scene is on an upswing. Anecdotal evidence includes increased attendance at events like <a href="http://www.webinnovatorsgroup.com/">WebInno</a>, <a href="http://boston.going.com/event-122245">OpenCoffees</a>, etc. But so far, few real hits. Maybe <a href="http://going.com">Going</a> will take off as the social network for the post-college crowd?

Ironic that the leading makers of technology that allow the world to communicate from anywhere and form new social networks still huddle around the Valley.
