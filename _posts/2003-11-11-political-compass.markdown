<a href="http://www.politicalcompass.org">Politicalcompass.org</a> says I'm a left-leaning moderate, more liberal politically than economically. Sounds about right, although in reading some of their questions I'd like to know how it's scored.

Their ranking probably explains why I can like both Al Gore's <a href="http://www.moveon.org/gore/speech2.html">recent speech on freedom and homeland security</a> and President Bush's <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/news/releases/2003/11/20031106-2.html">speech on freedom and democracy in the Middle East</a>. 

Gore's speech argues that the fight against terrorism has not been aided by granting increased governmental powers, and that it obscured the real steps necessary to increase security for ports, first responders, electrical/nuclear facilities, etc. So my question is: where was this guy in 2000? And which candidate will be this clear and direct in 2004?

The President's speech shows his hopeful vision for democracy in the region, but is slim on <a href="http://www.fareedzakaria.com/articles/newsweek/111703.html">describing how it is to come about</a>:

<i>"As we watch and encourage reforms in the region, we are mindful that modernization is not the same as Westernization. Representative governments in the Middle East will reflect their own cultures. They will not, and should not, look like us. Democratic nations may be constitutional monarchies, federal republics, or parliamentary systems. And working democracies always need time to develop -- as did our own."</i>
