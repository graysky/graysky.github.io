When I was young I played a lot of chess with my father, who is a competitive player, and in several tournaments. (Gee, big surprise I ended up as a technology nerd.) While I was never going to be a Bobby Fischer or <a href="http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1950939,00.html">Magnus Carlsen</a> I learned lot from playing beyond just the game itself. Several lessons from chess apply to running a startup.

<h3>Focus on the Middle Game</h3>

In chess there is more written about openings (the Queen's Gambit, the RÃ©ti, Dutch defense, etc.) and endgames (mating strategies with various material) than middle games. Similarly more time is spent writing about startup openings (product launch, raising money, first hires) and endgames (acquisitions &amp; exits, scaling big) than the middle game. It is an understandable pattern because the <a href="http://mathworld.wolfram.com/Chess.html">permutations for a chess game are enormous</a> and for startups the middle period tends to be the most particular to their situation and what has come before.

The challenge is that most games are won or lost in the middle. While it is certainly possible to hang yourself during the opening or blunder in the endgame the real competition in the slow grind for positional and material advantage.

For startups this can mean:
<ul>
	<li>Hiring the 10th employee</li>
	<li>Post-launch when things are so-so</li>
	<li>Finding right pricing</li>
	<li>2nd round of financing</li>
</ul>

- Openings / Endings
  - Easier to reason about, smaller set of variables
	- Not where game is often won / lost
	- Post-incubator timeframe, when things get complicated

<h3>Both Sides Get to Move</h3>
	
- Tempo?
- Chess for Startupers
	- Both sides get a move; putting yourself in other's position
	- Several moves ahead
- Revealing information with each move

- Wish we could study startup games like chess
- Chess is utterly fair
