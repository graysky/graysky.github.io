I've been with <a href="http://oneforty.com">oneforty</a> for 2+ years from <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/downtree/4184110610/in/set-72157623595674129/">early days</a> at <a href="http://www.techstars.org/">TechStars</a> and learned an enormous amount from great teammates, investors & advisors as well as from being in the startup trenches. It has been a time of successes, challenges and every other part of the startup roller coaster. I'm deeply grateful for the opportunity and support that I've been given. <strong>Today, I'm happy to share that <a href="http://www.hubspot.com/oneforty">oneforty has been acquired by HubSpot</a>!</strong>

<a href="http://www.hubspot.com">HubSpot</a> is transforming how marketing is done and plans to become the <a href="http://tech.fortune.cnn.com/2011/08/08/hubspot-wants-to-be-salesforce-com-for-small-business/">"Salesforce for Small-Business"</a>. As I've <a href="/2011/03/reverse-the-startup-curse/">written before</a> I love that they are swinging for the fences. From the beginning oneforty has aimed to simplify the challenges of social media around finding the best tools, having the right knowledge and, most recently, collaborating effectively. We think the problems we've been working on are well-aligned with HubSpot's bold vision.

To achieve this mission they have been <a href="http://www.hubspot.com/blog/bid/16943/HubSpot-Acquires-Marketing-Automation-Company-Performable">assembling a great team</a>. I'm excited to have the chance to work with folks like <a href="http://onstartups.com/">Dharmesh</a>, <a href="http://www.hubspot.com/company/management/brian-halligan/">Brian</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/YoavShapira">Yoav</a> and <a href="http://davidcancel.com/">David</a> (among many others) whom I plan to learn from. Big challenges still lay ahead, <a href="http://bostonbattle.com">sounds like fun</a>.
