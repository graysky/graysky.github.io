Everyone knows startups are hot, fueled by a strong (or frothy) seed funding climate and well-publicized successes like Groupon, Zynga and Facebook. I'm a proponent of young folks (i.e. early 20s) founding or working at early-stage startups for a number of reasons such as seeing the whole business, getting more responsibility and seeing how a product and company grow. But when I talk to smart, young people who are ridiculously gung-ho on startups I want to offer a few words of caution as they contemplate their options.

(For those who found a successful startup or are on the early team of a huge <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2010/02/21/mike-maples-talks-venture-capital-and-thunder-lizards/">thunder lizard</a>, congratulations! You're living the dream and your ticket has been punched. This is for the other 90% of folks who may not have such good fortune.)

<ol>
<li><strong>Learning Lessons the Hard(est) Way</strong> - Picking which companies are going to be successful is extremely difficult (and if I could do it I would be significantly wealthier.) 
</li>
	
	
<li><strong>Capabilities Better than Resume</strong> - 
</li>
	
<li><strong>Ambitious Problems?</strong></li>
	
<li><strong>Beware the Burnout</strong> - If you're in the <a href="http://www.fourhourworkweek.com/blog/2008/10/03/harnessing-entrepreneurial-manic-depression-making-the-rollercoaster-work-for-you/">"Uninformed Optimism"</a> phase it's hard to imagine why others would ever make the choice to work at a boring, staid companies when they could be their own boss on a mission to change the world. The halls of big companies have plenty of people who worked at one or two startups that didn't pan out and they got off the rollercoaster. The true serial entrepreneur is rare-breed. And you have a long career ahead of you.

</ol>
Concerned that they are going to:

- Learn lessons the hard way
- Opp cost of not learning from kick-ass graybeards
- End up with little savings, wrong resume for certain gigs
- Many burn out after couple startups
- Miss working on ambitious projects
