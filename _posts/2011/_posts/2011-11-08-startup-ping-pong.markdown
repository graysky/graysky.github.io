If you're like me and enjoy both startups and ping pong then you'll love <a href="http://startuppingpong.com">Startup Ping Pong</a>! The objective is to bring together players of any level who the enjoy the <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFuyh62AJho">epic game</a> of ping pong. And if you need convincing that ping pong is indeed epic, check out the <a href="http://penny-arcade.com/comic/2008/06/26">Penny Arcade series, "Paint the Line"</a>.

Currently I'm pulling together the ones in Boston and <a href="http://twitter.com/acoustik">Ajay</a> of Groupme is running one in NYC. <a href="http://startuppingpong.com">Sign up</a> if you'd notified when the next event is in your city, and follow <a href="http://twitter.com/StartupPingPong">@StartupPingPong</a>. Of course, we're always looking for sponsors to buy pizza &amp; beer if you'd like to be in the good graces of some startup folks.

After a brief hiatus I have pulled together the details for the 2<sup>nd</sup> event in Boston. It will be <strong>Tuesday, Nov 15<sup>th</sup> at HubSpot</strong> - please <a href="http://new.evite.com/services/links/5MM3UDUL2C">RSVP if you'd like to attend</a>. The first event was a good time (<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/downtree/sets/72157627088779002/with/5889411101/">photographic proof</a>) since there is no better way to take a break from cranking away than solely focusing on hitting a little ping pong ball with a paddle.
