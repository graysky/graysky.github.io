In keeping with <a href="/2010/12/favorite-albums-2010/">tradition</a>, here is a quick summary of music I've loved from the past year. In past years I'd used iTunes playcounts as a barometer for my enjoyment but this year I mostly switched to <a href="http://www.spotify.com/">Spotify</a> so have less data to pull from. I <a href="http://open.spotify.com/user/mikechampion/playlist/69BebRGM5QxPcqNlMSt4bT">published a Spotify playlist</a> of some of the best songs from the albums included.

<p><strong>10.</strong> Real Estate, <a href="http://open.spotify.com/album/43uj7422MLR9MRBXSki0El"><em>Days</em></a> - Definitely pretty sleepy but pretty and at its best feels like it is building toward something.
	
<p><strong>9.</strong> Panda Bear, <a href="http://open.spotify.com/album/3SH1o5bO60CTibwxdYOFyo"><em>Tomboy</em></a> - I really like the sound he has developed - this kind of hazy, surf-y atmospheric is a great soundtrack for a certain mood.
	
<p><strong>8.</strong> Holy Ghost!, <a href="http://open.spotify.com/album/3CAnQVAOA2iU9xw4xcoMO3"><em>Holy Ghost!</em></a> - Fun, synth-fuelded dance-y 80s pop. The best songs are front-loaded on this album.
	
<p><strong>7.</strong> Foo Fighters, <a href="http://open.spotify.com/album/5lnQLEUiVDkLbFJHXHQu9m"><em>Wasting Light</em></a> - I miss good rock music. This Foo Fighters album feels like a return to their more straight-ahead rock with less interruptions by ballads.
	
<p><strong>6.</strong> Iron &amp; Wine, <a href="http://open.spotify.com/album/3hmNV7XrYwJOknTC1lhOBg"><em>Kiss Each Other Clean</em></a> - Continuing his more textured sounds this album from early in the year planted songs like "Rabbit Will Run" in my head.

<p><strong>5.</strong> Girls, <a href="http://open.spotify.com/album/66wRO7SK0Wo1KS40en2tua"><em>Father, Son, Holy Ghost</em></a> - Great album all the way through although the faster, upbeat opening 3 tracks are what I find myself replaying.
	
<p><strong>4.</strong> Foster the People, <a href="http://open.spotify.com/album/7Kmmw7Z5D2UD5MVwdm10sT"><em>Torches</em></a> - Goddamn they wrote a catchy set of songs, and I am not immune.

<p><strong>3.</strong> M83, <a href="http://open.spotify.com/album/6yZtkhTr6TXRoUR72lveEU"><em>Hurry Up We're Dreaming</em></a> - Sweeping album made me like it despite how close it comes to sounding like songs from <i>The Breakfast Club</i>.

<p><strong>2.</strong> Kanye West &amp; Jay Z, <a href="http://open.spotify.com/album/0OcMap99vLEeGkBCfCwRwS"><em>Watch the Throne</em></a> - It took me a while to get into this album I think because I had such high expectations for it. "Otis" got a lot of attention but it was songs like "Who Gon Stop Me" and "Gotta Have It" that won me over.
 		
<p><strong>1.</strong> Bon Iver, <a href="http://open.spotify.com/album/0ZMzEAuUIylHgetdWqzcHU"><em>Bon Iver</em></a> - Impressive and haunting album that is strong and cohesive even with the variation he employs.
