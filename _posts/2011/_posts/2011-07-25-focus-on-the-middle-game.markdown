When I was young I played a lot of chess with my father, who is a competitive player, and in several tournaments. While I was never going to be a Bobby Fischer or <a href="http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1950939,00.html">Magnus Carlsen</a> I learned lot from playing beyond just the game itself. Several lessons from chess apply to running a startup.

<h3>Focus on the Middle Game</h3>

In chess there is a lot more written about openings &mdash; the Queen's Gambit, the RÃ©ti, Dutch defense, etc, &mdash; and end games

- Openings / Endings
  - Easier to reason about, smaller set of variables
	- Not where game is often won / lost
	- Post-incubator timeframe, when things get complicated

<h3>Both Sides Get to Move</h3>
	
- Tempo?
- Chess for Startupers
	- Both sides get a move; putting yourself in other's position
	- Several moves ahead
