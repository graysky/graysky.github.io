title: Reverse the Curse
layout: post

I was born &amp; raised in the Boston area, so the most recent <a href="http://www.boston.com/business/technology/innoeco/2011/03/whats_the_point_of_boston_vs_s.html">dust</a> <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2011/03/04/my-ordeal%E2%80%94and-the-firestorm%E2%80%94in-boston/">up</a> about Boston vs Silicon Valley has me comparing it to Beantown's previous long-lived case of self-flagellation - <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curse_of_the_Bambino">The Curse of the Bambino</a>.

For the Red Sox it was the trading of Babe Ruth while for Boston web startups it was loss of Zuckerberg and Facebook to Palo Alto. That sin has cast loads of self-doubt on whether Boston can ever truly compete, often with those in the Boston tech scene being the most critical of its short-comings. Like Red Sox Nation living under The Curse, those in the Boston startup community can often feel like losers despite being in the 2nd (or 3rd, depending on how you rank NYC) best market. Compare this to the confidence of those from Boulder who have a Moneyball-era A's knowledge that they are punching above their weight for a city of 100,000.

The good news is that we're no longer in our <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mo_Vaughn">Mo Vaughn</a> / <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_Greenwell">Mike Greenwell</a> era of frequent disappointments. During my five years around the Boston startup community I've seen <a href="http://www.robgo.org/post/653240595/an-entrepreneurial-renaissance-in-boston">things improve considerably.</a> While there is still lots of work to do, I think we're <a href="http://www.quora.com/Boston/What-is-the-entrepreneurial-startup-scene-like-in-the-Greater-Boston-Area-in-2011">assembling our "2004" roster</a>:

<ul>
	<li>Like <strong>David Ortiz</strong>, Hubspot is <a href="http://www.hubspot.com/blog/bid/10491/Sequoia-Google-Ventures-and-Salesforce-com-Invest-32-Million-in-HubSpot">swinging for the fences</a> with their $32M raise, and <a href="http://twitter.com/dharmesh">Dharmesh "Big Papi" Shah</a> has shown how to remain a hacker while dominating marketing and building a growth business.</li>
		
	<li>Long-time leaders like <a href="http://billwarner.posterous.com/">Bill Warner</a> have been the <strong>Jason Varitek</strong> to teach the team how the <a href="http://billwarner.posterous.com/its-about-leadership-a-proposed-scorecard-for">game should be played.</li>
	
	<li><a href="http://www.scvngr.com/">SCVNGR</a> and <a href="http://where.com">WHERE</a> resemble a certain <strong>Manny Ramírez</strong> - not always well-understood &amp; looking to hit it deep. SCVNGR's Seth Priebatsch keynoting SXSW and <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2011/03/10/scvngr-launches-spinoff-levelup-daily-deals-meet-location-based-gaming/">building LevelUp to challenge Groupon and LivingSocial</a> has an air of "Manny Being Manny" to it.
	</li>
	
	<li>Companies like <a href="http://www.gemvara.com/">Gemvara</a>, <a href="http://www.csnstores.com/">CSN Stores</a> and <a href="http://viximo.com/">Viximo</a> stay modest while they are consistently putting up numbers north of .300 like <strong>Bill Mueller</strong>.</li>
	
	<li>Folks like Greenhorn's Jason Evanish, <a href="http://victoriasong.me/">Victoria Song</a> and the <a href="http://dartboston.com/">DartBoston</a> crew have that <strong>Kevin Millar</strong> <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVyobFoH0-E">"why not us?"</a> attitude that sparks others to do more. (Just avoid the Arroyo cornrows, please.)</li>
	
	<li>Lean startup devotees <a href="http://www.performable.com/">Performable</a> and <a href="http://blueleaf.com/">Blueleaf</a> have the iteration speed of <strong>bearded Johnny Damon</strong>.</li>
