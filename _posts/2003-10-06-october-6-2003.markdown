This is a <a href="http://www.boston.com/sports/baseball/redsox/articles/2003/10/06/red_sox_machine_still_roaring/">great moment to be a Red Sox fan</a>, with Ortiz stepping up yesterday give them the lead over the A's and Williamson pitching two great final innings. It's down to a game in Oakland, and possibly an American League Championship Series with the Yankees. If that happens, I'm predicting many anxiety-related deaths among those in the so-called "Red Sox Nation".

And I think there is a bit of media bias in the coverage of the come-from-behind victory yesterday: the NYTimes reports <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2003/10/06/sports/baseball/06sox.html">"Red Sox Live Another Day"</a>, when a much more accurate statement is found in the Globe's headline <a href="http://www.boston.com/sports/baseball/redsox/articles/2003/10/06/red_sox_machine_still_roaring/">"Red Sox Machine Still Roaring"</a>.

Or, if you are not into such things, maybe you can get excited about something else like, um, it being the first Monday in October and the <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2003/10/06/national/06SCOT.html">Supreme Court opening its new term</a>. But it's hard to get excited about records like "10 years without a turnover on the Court" when the Curse might be broken.
