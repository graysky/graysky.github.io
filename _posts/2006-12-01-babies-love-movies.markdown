Last night we went to see <a href="http://imdb.com/title/tt0482571/">The Prestige</a> and as it's nearly out of the regular theaters, it was only showing at the Entertainment Cinemas in Fresh Pond, Cambridge. And without fail everytime I go there someone decides to bring their baby. Their crying baby. Last time it was someone who thought their small child would enjoy Kevin Bacon's performance in <a href="http://imdb.com/title/tt0361127/">The Woodsman</a>. Classy.
