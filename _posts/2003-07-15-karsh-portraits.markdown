Had an unexpected chance to look at some portraits by <a href="http://www.mfa.org/exhibitions/karsh.html">Yousuf Karsh</a>. Great images of interesting people of the last century including <a href="http://www.masters-of-photography.com/K/karsh/karsh_churchill_full.html">statesmen</a>, <a href="http://www.masters-of-photography.com/K/karsh/karsh_hemingway_full.html">artists</a> and <a href="http://www.masters-of-photography.com/K/karsh/karsh_einstein_full.html">scientists</a> among <a href="http://www.masters-of-photography.com/K/karsh/karsh_farmer.html">others</a>. Also, I enjoyed seeing the <a href="http://www.westongallery.com/artists/y_karsh/yousuf_karsh.html">faces </a> of those whom I'd only read their <a href="http://www.geh.org/ne/mismi3/m198130600037_ful.html#topofimage">name</a>. Not that many online, so I may pick up a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0878466711/mikechampion">book collection of them</a>.
