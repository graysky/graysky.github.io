<a href="http://nerdcoreforlife.com/">Nerdcore for Life</a>. Finally there is a movie about my kind of people. My <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A8VTmy5clHk">favorite part of the trailer</a> is when a show is introduced with, "you're going to hear people rap about comics books, video games, role playing, nondeterministic finite automata". The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nondeterministic_finite_state_machine">NFA</a> part slides in as though everyone will obviously know what they are. Nice.

Also, I don't know what a diamond video games or if an arcade made of gold makes sense, but I want one.
