Sometimes I get jealous of northern California. Warmer weather. More tech activity. Then adding insult to injury, there are shows <a href="http://tourb.us/show/20003">like this one</a> -- The Shins, The Raconteurs, Modest Mouse, Silversun Pickups and The Killers -- and my jealousy spikes. That might even be worth the $50 ticket price, and with The Killers playing it would leave me plenty of time to check out the merch table (oh <em>snap</em>). The <a href="http://tourb.us/silversunpickups">Silversun Pickups</a> have stayed in heavy rotation in my headphones recently, and somehow even radio stations have realized they should play them; "Lazy Eye" does makes a catchy single. I'm still kicking myself that I couldn't make their recent local shows. And to top it off, the <a href="http://tourb.us/chavez">Chavez</a> reunion shows will take them out there, but not to Boston. Damn.

But, I remember there was a few days in sixth grade when I jealous of my friend's ability to do the "Running Man". Jealousy often looks silly in hindsight. Like, say if that <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Andreas_Fault">San Andreas fault</a> gets to shaking and sliding.
