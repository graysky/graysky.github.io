When I saw today that <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2007/08/14/sports/baseball/14cnd-rizzuto.html">Phil Rizzuto</a> had passed away, I thought of the strange lyrics from <a href="http://paulsboutique.info/What_Comes_Around">"What Comes Around"</a> off the Beastie Boys classic <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul's_Boutique">"Paul's Boutique"</a>:

<blockquote>
Bum cheese on rye with ham and prosciutto
Got more Louie than Phillip Rizzuto
</blockquote>

I listened to that album repeatedly while feeling like 16-year-old badass with a driver's license in mom's car. My friends and fellow Beastie fans tried to <a href="http://paulsboutique.info">pick out all the samples</a> (although I bet we didn't get 1/10th). Still not exactly sure what they were saying about the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phil_Rizzuto">former Yankees shortstop and Money Store spokesman</a>.
