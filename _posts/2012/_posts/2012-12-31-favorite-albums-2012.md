Despite my lack of writing in 2012, <a href="/2011/12/favorite-albums-2011/">traditions must be respected</a>. Outside of the music itself it was another year where I effectively only listened (and paid) to music from Spotify (some Rdio, etc), and bought a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B005441AJC/?tag=mikechampion">Sonos Play 3</a> in part to more easily stream Spotify to home speakers. Below are a few of the albums I enjoyed most in 2012, and a <a href="http://open.spotify.com/user/mikechampion/playlist/1LQaNMF87mAzT6UYFbNFUf">Spotify playlist of selected songs</a> from them. This year there was a lot of albums I liked but few I deeply loved.

<p><strong>10.</strong> The Shins, <a href="http://open.spotify.com/album/4ZTcGoOrNro2aCAStXEjZi"><em>Port of Morrow</em></a> - Their latest felt like a welcome return to the early Shins. "The Rifle's Spiral" and "September" are both solid, but "Simple Song" is the obvious standout. Fantastic song.
</p>

<p><strong>9.</strong> Sleigh Bells, <a href="http://open.spotify.com/album/1QJsT9ZXcBp9fWpx4cAMIz"><em>Reign of Terror</em></a> - Only a couple tracks, like "Comeback Kid", reach what they nailed on "Treats" but even slowed down their dynamics are great.
</p>

<p><strong>8.</strong> Metric, <a href="http://open.spotify.com/album/1WDdaw9niyv06kRmspU1U4"><em>Synthetica</em></a> - They have developed an interesting synth/new-wave-ish sound that keeps it interesting. Not as rocking as "Fantasties" although found its way into regular rotation.
</p>

<p><strong>7.</strong> Cat Power, <a href="http://open.spotify.com/album/2JQgZJD5VKJkBMHBCkGQO0"><em>Sun</em></a> - My favorite Cat Power album to date. She's had moments of brilliance in the past and I think this album flows from start to finish. 
</p>

<p><strong>6.</strong> Japandroids, <a href="http://open.spotify.com/album/2sY9WYVH022ulyAYaqvXLW"><em>Celebration Rock</em></a> - It took me a while to get into this album before it clicked. Their energy is infectious. They remind me of what I once loved about <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piebald_(band)">Piebald</a> and how they crashed forward.
</p>

<p><strong>5.</strong> Kanye West presents Good Music, <a href="http://open.spotify.com/album/0cGgwoMge4N2zpTiP2GU6d"><em>Cruel Summer</em></a> - I think I have to admit I'm a fan of whatever Kanye puts out. The album has a mix of styles and some of the best lyrics ("I believe there's a god above me / I'm just the god of everything else"). Even features a Ma$e appearance! Oddly one of the duds is the Kid Cudi track which feels recycled. 
</p>

<p><strong>4.</strong> Frank Ocean, <a href="http://open.spotify.com/album/392p3shh2jkxUxY2VHvlH8"><em>channel Orange</em></a> - Plenty has been written, understandably, about this captivating album. It feels almost sneaky how good it is since it comes in such a smooth package.
</p>

<p><strong>3.</strong> Electric Guest, <a href="http://open.spotify.com/album/2X6C2XbrTEEpPcQhbDxTTM"><em>Mondo</em></a> - In reading a few year end round-ups I thought this album deserved better that it received. The Danger Mouse-produced album has his signature style of a mix of throwback and modern production. Bottom line is that it kept my foot tapping and stayed in my head.
</p>

<p><strong>2.</strong> Cloud Nothings, <a href="http://open.spotify.com/album/1JgpvdsSfE94eZzYBk6ph9"><em>Attack on Memory</em></a> - Impressive and solid album throughout, and <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&v=SX9qxzbAu6E#t=183s">"Fall In"</a> was my jam for weeks. I would love to see this album performed live, everything has such urgency. 
</p>

<p><strong>1.</strong> Kendrick Lamar, <a href="http://open.spotify.com/album/1DqhWr73Fh5yoNzKLas0G3"><em>good kid, m.A.A.d city</em></a> - If Dre likes him, how can I not? Songs like "Backseat Freestyle" and "m.A.A.d city" are amazingly catchy, and the album is surprising in all the best ways when so much of hip hop isn't.
