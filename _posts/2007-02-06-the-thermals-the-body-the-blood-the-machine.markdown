A friend recently pointed me toward <a href="http://www.myspace.com/thethermals">The Thermals</a> new album, <em>The Body, the Blood, the Machine</em>. Despite some <a href="http://pitchforkmedia.com/article/record_review/38033/The_Thermals_The_Body_The_Blood_The_Machine">positive reviews</a> they have flown entirely under my radar, and even if I'd read the reviews, I would passed it over. On paper, I wouldn't like a political, pop-punk <a href="http://pitchforkmedia.com/article/feature/38015/Interview_Interview_The_Thermals">"sort of" a concept</a> album. That description and the inevitable comparison to <em>American Idiot</em> belies how well it works. A quick listen to <a href="http://hype.non-standard.net/artist/the+thermals">"Here's Your Future"</a> made that clear (more than their <a href="http://youtube.com/watch?v=A4Iobo18U9w">poor video</a>). And The Thermals will be playing at <a href="http://tourb.us/show/24897">T.T.'s the Bears in a few weeks</a>, just in time to thaw the ice covering Cambridge.
