I wonder why people expect so little from user interfaces? <i>sigh</i>. 

As a counter-example, I've enjoyed using <a href="http://www.apple.com/itunes/">iTunes for Windows</a>. Definitely a step in the right direction for ease of use and digital music. Hell, this alone makes me want to get an iPod. And those <a href="http://www.apple.com/ipod/ads/">ads with the dancing people</a>.
