</a><br />Behold the glory that is SSX3</center>

I can attest that <a href="http://www.easportsbig.com/games/ssx3/home.jsp">SSX3</a> rawks (like the kids spell it). The <a href="http://www.gamespot.com/ps2/sports/ssx3/preview_6075289.html">reviews</a> weren't wrong. It's one of those games you can play forever, say, instead of studying for an upcoming midterm exam. My skillz (that's right, with a 'z') have atrophied quite a bit since their peak senior year, so I guess I'm going to need to play a lot to regain them. And hey, I'm taking a computer graphics class, so this is really just research.
