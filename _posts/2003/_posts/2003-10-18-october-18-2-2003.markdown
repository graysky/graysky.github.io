My <a href="http://www.wellesley.mec.edu/whs/whs_home.htm">high school</a> was in <a href="http://www.boston.com/news/local/articles/2003/10/15/wellesley_school_links_graffiti_to_metco_teen/">the news this week</a> (including the local paper, <a href="http://www.townonline.com/wellesley/news/local_regional/wt_covwtgraffitims10162003.htm">the Townsman</a>).

<i>The threatening and apparently antiblack graffiti scrawled in a bathroom stall at Wellesley High School was the work of a black teenager enrolled in the school through the Metco desegregation program, officials said yesterday.
 
The graffiti, which said the school would "burn" on Oct. 15 or 17 and that "there will be no blacks," had prompted a police investigation and public concern about racism in the hallways of one of the state's top-ranked high schools.</i>
