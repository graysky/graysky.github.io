I've been listening to two albums by my favorite comedian from when I was younger, <a href="http://www.billhicks.com">Bill Hicks</a>. The pair, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B0000009QI/mikechampion">Rant in E-Minor</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B0000009QG/mikechampion">Relentless</a>, are both filled with dark jokes from the early 90s. His rants against President Bush Sr. and Gulf War 1 seem oddly relevant given the sequels to both. Hicks' style was different than comedians who either play it safe (airline jokes, "didya ever notice?...", etc.) or aim to shock without having anything biting to say. Hicks was both funnier and more intelligent in his joking on <a href="http://www.sacredcow.com/media/source/store_items/rant/easter.mp3">religion</a>, <a href="http://www.sacredcow.com/media/source/store_items/rant/orange_drink.mp3">artistic integrity</a>, <a href="http://www.sacredcow.com/media/source/store_items/relentless/the_war.mp3">war</a>, <a href="http://www.sacredcow.com/media/source/store_items/rant/the_elite.mp3">politics</a> and <a href="http://www.sacredcow.com/media/source/store_items/relentless/great_times.mp3">drugs</a> than so many of the Jay Leno clones out there.
