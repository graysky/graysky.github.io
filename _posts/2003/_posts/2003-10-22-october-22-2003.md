On something of an impulse I bought an <a href="http://www.apple.com/ipod">iPod</a> (along with the new Belle & Sebastian and Shins albums). The combination of the 3rd gen iPods and iTunes for Windows got the better of me. And something about the red-backlighting on the buttons clinched it while I was in the <a href="http://www.apple.com/retail/cambridgeside/">local Apple store</a>. I'm glad to see I'm not the <a href="http://www.penny-arcade.com/view.php3?date=2003-10-20&res=l">only one who feels this way</a>. On a crowded plane last week, while trying unsuccessfully to drown out the conversation of those sitting behind me with a <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0317740/">bad movie</a>, I thought "What would be even better is if I had every album I own with me". Now I just need to rip a couple hundred CDs.
