So way back when, I complained that there are no shows that make economics seem interesting. I've been proven wrong.

<a href="http://www.pbs.org">PBS</a> produced a fascinating show called <a href="http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/commandingheights/">"Commanding Heights: The Battle for the World Economy"</a>, based on a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/068483569X/mikechampion">book by the same name</a> (shows <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00006HAZF/mikechampion">available on DVD</a>). It's always hard to get good images for amorphous things like globalization, world trade and financial markets, but they do an admirable job to make it visually stimulating (and only in the beginning to they do the cliched 0s and 1s flying by). But what really sets it apart is the cogent presentation of the changes in the world's economies over the last 50 years and the <a href="http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/commandingheights/lo/people/pe_name.html">great interviews</a> with those who had a hand in shaping history. Great television regardless of how you feel about "globalization" and the capitalist revolution.
