<a href="http://users.cis.net/sammy/school.htm">School's out for summer!</a> Which in this case is only 3 weeks, but a break is still welcome. (Of course there was a <a href="http://www.bravotv.com/The_West_Wing/">West Wing marathon</a> of early episodes this weekend when I was working on a final project. Thanks <a href="http://www.replaytv.com">ReplayTV</a>.) Just finished a good <a href="http://people.bu.edu/rom/syllabi/cs579/cs579summer.htm">Design Patterns</a> course and an okay <a href="http://people.bu.edu/kalathur/cs665_summer_03/metcs665.htm">Database</a> course. This Fall I'm taking two classes in areas I know nothing about,  <a href="http://courses.dce.harvard.edu/~cscie234/">Computer Graphics </a> and <a href="http://metcs.bu.edu/~ebraude/767/sl767.htm">Fuzzy, Expert, Genetic and Neural Systems</a>. Sounds like that one will be an overview considering how much material there must be.

Looking through some of the <a href="http://www.extension.harvard.edu/2003-04/courses/default.jsp">Harvard Extension catalog</a> for classes that I would enjoy taking that are unrelated to work. There are a bunch, and for the $300 it's a steal. I think they fixed the tuition to the going price on a wheat bushel from <a href="http://www.extension.harvard.edu/2003-04/about/message.jsp">Nineteen-Aught-Nine</a> to let us locals get some book-learning.
