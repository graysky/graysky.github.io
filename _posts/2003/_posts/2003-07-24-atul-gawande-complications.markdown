On a recent visit to <a href="http://www.brighamandwomens.org">Brigham and Women's Hospital</a> I noticed that their elavator doesn't have a 13th floor button (they had a floor labeled M2 somewhere below I believe). I know this is a common practice, but I'd have thought that for an institution based on science they might have forgone this <a href="http://www.everything2.com/index.pl?node=The%20Thirteenth%20Floor">superstition</a>. And does simply not labeling a floor avoid the bad luck? There <i>still is</i> a 13th floor after all.

On the other hand, while I was there, I was reading <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0312421702/mikechampion/"><i>Complications</i></a> by <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/unbound/interviews/int2002-05-01.htm">Atul Gawande</a> (himself a surgeon at BWH and contributer to <i>The New Yorker</i>). The book nicely details the imperfection and fallibility of medicine and those who practice it, so maybe keeping any extra bad luck away can't hurt. (He appeared on the <a href="http://www.onpointradio.org/shows/2002/04/20020429_b_main.asp">WBUR show On Point last year</a>.)

And on the subject of luck, I recently saw <a href="http://us.imdb.com/Title?0220580">Intacto</a>. A cool film where luck is an important and transferable quality.
