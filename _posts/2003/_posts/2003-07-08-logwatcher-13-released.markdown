The lastest (and likely final) release of a project named <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/graysky">Logwatcher</a> that I've helped a bit on was just released. 

<a href="http://graysky.sourceforge.net/">Logwatcher</a> is an <a href="http://www.eclipse.org">Eclipse plugin</a> that allows text files to be monitored for changes (similar to the Unix <i>tail</i> utility). Very helpful for further integrating common tasks inside the Eclipse environment. People have had <a href="http://eclipse-plugins.2y.net/eclipse/plugin_comments.jsp?id=224">nice things to say</a>. So <a href="http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=70450">get yours today</a>.
