In the NYTimes magazine's Year of Ideas, the most puzzling and interesting was entitled <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2003/12/14/magazine/14COINCIDENCE.html">"Coincidence Theory"</a>. It describes 20 years of research into whether humans can change the outcome of a random number generator. The answer so far is yes, in a tiny way. From the article:

<blockquote>Mayer's research and writings eventually led her to <a href="http://alfven.princeton.edu/personnel/jahn.htm">Robert G. Jahn</a>, a science and engineering professor at Princeton. Since 1979, Jahn had amassed a mountain of data demonstrating <a href="http://www.princeton.edu/~pear/">people's ability to alter the outcome of a random event generator</a> -- essentially a machine designed to replicate a perfect coin toss over and over -- in a minute but statistically significant way.
</blockquote>

It looks like the "anomalous effects" have been reproduced many other places, but the theories as to <i>why</i> it might be true all sound unbelievable.

<b>Update:</b> Looks like many other believe this to be a <a href="http://goodmath.blogspot.com/2006/04/bad-math-of-paranormal-research-pear.html">bogus study</a>. Looks like you can't trust what you read in the Times.
