I enjoyed the Sorkin-less <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2003/09/24/arts/television/24STAN.html">West Wing season premiere</a> last night. The show slipped some last season (even though <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2003/09/22/arts/television/22EMMY.html">it still won the Emmy</a>), so a <a href="http://www.boston.com/dailyglobe2/267/living/A_new_chief_slightly_alters_West_Wing_+.shtml">shake-up in the Bartlett White House</a> was in order. <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000422/">John Goodman</a> plays President Walken well IMHO, and while the dialogue wasn't quite at Sorkin's pace, how many shows have lines that make comparisons to an <a href="http://www.m-w.com/cgi-bin/dictionary?va=auto-da-fe">auto-de-fe</a>? And the final montage with Lisa Gerrard's ''Sanvean'' in the background is a typical tear-jerking Sorkin move (although for my money the Charlie-Bartlett scenes are more emotional). <a href="http://forums.televisionwithoutpity.com/index.php?showtopic=3111933">The online fanactics</a> seem slightly more positive than negative, but express a wait-and-see attitude.
