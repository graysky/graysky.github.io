Up till 6 this morning finishing a <a href="http://courses.dce.harvard.edu/~cscie234/">raytracer for class</a>. It worked out fine with the <a href="http://www.graysky.org/pics/raytracer2.jpg">shadows, reflection</a> and Phong illumination working, but this has turned into a routine that has replaced sleeping on Sunday nights. I miss that. Thankfully it was the last assignment before a final project. And I'd like to point out that Harvard has the worst schedule possible with finals <em>after</em> winter break.
