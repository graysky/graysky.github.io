Saw the Decemberists at <a href="http://www.mideastclub.com">the MidEast</a> this week. Solid show - they played a bunch of their better songs and some good new ones.

Since Cambridge has banned smoking in bars and restaurants, my clothes & I no longer smell horrible afterwards. And instead of the faces in the darkened room glowing in the orange light of cigarettes, they are bathed in the blue-green of cell phones & digital cameras. Progress!
