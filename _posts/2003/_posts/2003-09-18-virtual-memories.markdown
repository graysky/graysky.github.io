I've been wasting time playing <a href="http://www.soulcalibur.com">Soul Calibur 2</a> recently. The first release, along with <a href="http://www.playstation2.ea.com/gamepage_ssx.html">SSX</a>, <a href="http://www.unrealtournament.com">UT</a>, were played <i>a lot</i> in my apartment during the college years. It's strange to reminisce about places and events that only happened in your mind. My friends and I talk about the hours we spent in Q2's Tokay's Towers, and still know the details of the map. And the memories aren't of staring at a monitor, but of actually being in this place - jumping from a ledge, looking up an elavator shaft, strafing around a corner - something akin to remembering a dream. Makes me think that in the future things will get interesting when you can hack someone's brain to put in memories, feelings and knowledge that feel real.
