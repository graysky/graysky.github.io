Last night I went to hear <a href="http://www.belleandsebastian.com">Belle & Sebastian</a> at the Orpheum on an incredibly windy night. It was a <a href="http://www.boston.com/news/globe/living/articles/2003/11/14/belle__sebastian_add_luster_to_pop/">solid show with a good mix</a> of the older stuff and the better tracks from <i><a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B0000CBHQ1/mikechampion">Dear Castrophe Waitress</a></i>. I appreciate their efficiency. They just come out and play their music, with a couple interludes and a flashy light show. Stuart Murdoch does his little dancing, the crowd goes wild, he makes some witty remarks that are barely understandable in his Scottish accent. But I did catch his Red Sox vs. Yankees comment. He made a joke about Boston needing to be better than New York in <i>at least</i> one thing, and for an instant the crowd turned against him. The lesson being that even though Bostonians love you, insulting the Red Sox can still mean not making it out of the place alive.
