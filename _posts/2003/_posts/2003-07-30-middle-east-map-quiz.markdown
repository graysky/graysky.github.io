Enlightening little game where you try to place <a href="http://www.rethinkingschools.org/just_fun/games/mapgame.html">MidEast country names on a map</a>. Find out how deficient your education is! I definitely did better in the Middle East than in northern Africa (because we have deployed less troops there?). And it goes without saying that you <a href="http://www.rethinkingschools.org/special_reports/maps/largemap.pdf">shouldn't cheat</a>. The game is part of a site on <a href="http://www.rethinkingschools.org/war/index.shtml">teaching about the war</a>.

To further refine one's sense of MidEast geography, I enjoyed this <a href="http://www.newyorker.com/printable/?fact/030804fa_fact">New Yorker article on finding Osama</a> by Jane Mayer. Helpful in understanding where Osama is thought to be and the complicated relationship the U.S. has with Pakistan.
