<a href="http://www.pbs.org/now/series/billmoyers.html">Bill Moyers</a> reminded me why I like him on <a href="http://www.pbs.org/now/index.html">NOW</a> this week with his <a href="http://www.pbs.org/now/transcript/transcript_peterson.html">interview of FRB of New York Chairman Pete Peterson</a> talking about the current deficit and future liabilities to retiring Boomers. Very enlightening, and Peterson deftly sidesteps Moyers attempt to use Peterson's claim soley as an anti-tax cut message (although he makes reasonable suggestions to modify the tax cut).

Peterson articulated much better than Krugman did about the <a href="http://boingboing.net/2003_10_01_archive.html#106502328153754563">coming economic dangers</a> and the political difficulty in dealing with the Boomer generation as they retire - both in the promises that were made and the economic reality of the situation. He also seems wise to phrase the issue (rightly) as a moral failure to make sacrafices to fund programs of national importance (such as homeland security) instead of saddling future generations with a growing deficit. Refreshing to see some honest commentary on economic matters that doesn't treat serious concerns as a political football.
