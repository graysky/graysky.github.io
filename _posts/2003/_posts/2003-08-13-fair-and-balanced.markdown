Been enjoying reading about the <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2003/08/12/nyregion/12FRAN.html">lawsuit Fox News filed against humorist Al Franken</a> about the use of the words "Fair and Balanced" in the title of his book <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0525947647/mikechampion ">"Lies, and the Lying Liars Who Tell Them: A Fair and Balanced Look at the Right"</a> (which has a <a href="http://images.amazon.com/images/P/0525947647.01.LZZZZZZZ.jpg">great cover shot</a>).

In part, the court papers filed by Fox called Franken "shrill and unstable" and "unfunny". Franken <a href="http://reuters.com/newsArticle.jhtml?type=entertainmentNews&storyID=3267004">has responded saying</a>,

<blockquote>  
"And by the way, a few months ago, I trademarked the word 'funny.' So when Fox calls me 'unfunny,' they're violating my trademark. I am seriously considering a countersuit"
</blockquote>

If Ann Coulter can accuse <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1400050308/mikechampion">liberals of the past 50 years of treason and treachery</a> and receive a warm welcome on the 24 hour news circuit, Franken should be able to call Bill O'Reilly a liar and not face a lawsuit. And I still want to see his book review on <a href="http://spinsanity.org">spinsanity.org</a> next to <a href="http://spinsanity.org/columns/20030630.html">Coulter's</a> (and <a href="http://www.spinsanity.org/columns/20020403.html">Moore's</a>), although <a href="http://www.theonionavclub.com/avclub3639/bonusfeature1_3639.html">Franken's will unarguably be funnier</a>.
