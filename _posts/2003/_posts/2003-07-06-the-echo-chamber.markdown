Recently there was a <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/online/story/0,3605,989783,00.html">Guardian article on blogging</a> published about a <a href="http://blogs.law.harvard.edu/thursdays">Thursday night session</a> at Berkman that <a href="http://scriptingnews.userland.com/backissues/2003/06/13#When:4:38:55AM">I attended</a>. It picks up on the discussion around catalyzing weblog adoption in <a href="http://blogs.law.harvard.edu/crimson1/stories/storyReader$319">New Hampshire</a> for the presidental primaries. I think it is a worthwhile goal, if only to truly diversify who is writing interesting stories. Maybe it is the sites that I read, but certain weblogs can feel like being inside an echo chamber on certain issues. I've found little serious debate on issues like <a href="http://www.eldred.cc/">Eldred v. Ashcroft</a> or the <a href="http://anti-dmca.org/">DMCA</a>. Instead there has been too much preaching to the converted. So I'm all for expanding both the number of people posting and hopefully the range of opinions that are thoughtfully expressed.
