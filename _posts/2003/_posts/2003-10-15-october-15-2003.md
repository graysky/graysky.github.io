<i>It's a dirty little secret that you'll want to hide from your daughters: Boys hold their parents' marriages together, while girls break them up. 

That's the word from two leading economists at the University of Rochester and the University of California, Los Angeles who maintain that in the United States the parents of a girl are nearly 5 percent more likely to divorce than the parents of a boy, reports Slate magazine. The more daughters a couple has, the greater the chance of a marital split.</i>
