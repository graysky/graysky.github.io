My machine crashed and went into low-resolution safe mode and it felt like playing that one world in <a href="http://www.classicgaming.com/tmk/smb.shtml">Super Mario Bros.</a> where all the toadstools and lifts are much bigger than normal size. And of course all the graphics are 8-bit awesome. (This screenshot doesn't quite capture it because it'll be shown at too high a resolution.)
