Been playing around a little with this <a href="http://dev.eclipse.org/viewcvs/index.cgi/~checkout~/platform-swt-home/opengl/opengl.html">experimental SWT OpenGL plugin</a>. After some tweaking I got their OpenGL Example code working which shows some of the things you can do with Beziers, fog, anti-aliasing, etc. For a computer graphics class I've been writing OpenGL code in C++, so it's a nice change to see a Java API to OpenGL. I've been meaning to play around with <a href="http://java.sun.com/products/java-media/3D/">Java3D</a>, but haven't yet. I'm curious to know what, if anything, people have written using the SWT OpenGL plugin.
