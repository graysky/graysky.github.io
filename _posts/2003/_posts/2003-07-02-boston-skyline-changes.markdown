Spent some time browsing the <a href="http://www.bigdig.com/thtml/photos_vg.htm">changes to the streets</a> and <a href="http://www.sky-boston.com">cityscape of Boston</a>. Of those <a href="http://www.sky-boston.com/newskyscrapers/uc.shtml">under construction</a>, I think my favorite is <a href="http://www.33arch.com">33 arch street</a> (pic <a href="http://www.sky-boston.com/newskyscrapers/33arch/33arch1.jpg">one</a> and <a href="http://www.sky-boston.com/newskyscrapers/33arch/33arch2.jpg">two</a>). I like that it has a little flair to the design, and the renderings make it look somewhat futuristic. Also, I generally enjoy <a href="http://www.sky-boston.com/skyscrapers/boston500.shtml">office buildings</a> for some strange reason.

Thought the <a href="http://www.sky-boston.com/newskyscrapers/colonnade/">Colonnade Residences</a> looked nice - I could live there. Maybe I will move in there when they open, and when I have $10,000 to spend on rent each month. We'll see which comes first. 

Other various <a href="http://www.sky-boston.com/newskyscrapers/proposed.shtml">proposals are thought up</a> to add to the skyline. The day is quickly approaching when I can say, "<a href="http://www.sky-boston.com/newskyscrapers/sst/">None of those buildings</a> or <a href="http://www.bigdig.com/thtml/gw_crc.htm#bridge1">bridges</a> were here when I <a href="http://www.sky-boston.com/skyscrapers/frb/">was a kid</a>. We drove our cars on a <a href="http://www.bigdig.com">central artery</a> that clogged the city and that's the way we liked it!"
