The <a href="http://www.bosstones.com">Mighty Mighty Bosstones</a> won't be <a href="http://www.boston.com/news/globe/living/articles/2003/12/16/the_throwdown_no_bosstones_who_knows/">having their annual "Hometown Throwdown"</a> for the first time in 9 years. The article says the band is on hiatus - but don't worry, the dancing Bosstone is doing okay. Now I haven't been to one of their show's in years, but in high school those shows were always a good time. Back then I was loving "Devil's Night Out" and "More Noise & Other Disturbances" prior to all that "Impressions That I Get" crap. And heading to the MidEast in December to watch the crowd go nuts for "Awfully Quiet" or "Dr. D" was so much fun.
