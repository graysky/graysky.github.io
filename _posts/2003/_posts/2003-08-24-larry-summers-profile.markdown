Enjoyed the <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2003/08/24/magazine/24SUMMERS.html?pagewanted=all">profile of Harvard President Larry Summers</a>. The one time I heard him speak several years ago when he was at the Treasury, dealing with Asian financial crisis, he appeared to be a somewhat blunt and quirky speaker. But someone who genuinely wanted to be convinced by facts.

And I certainly agree with this quote of his, which could also be extended to his own academic field of economics,

<blockquote>"...while it is socially unacceptable at an elite university to admit that you haven't read a Shakespeare play, no stigma at all attaches to not knowing the difference between a gene and a chromosome or the meaning of exponential growth."
</blockquote>
