For my computer graphics class, we had to write a tiny program that does image compositing using <a href="http://www.opengl.org">OpenGL</a> to put weather images on a map of Middle Earth. I had forgotten both that I enjoy writing in C, and just how rusty I am with it. As much as I like Java, there is a certain directness and compactness to C. Although from my little experience with <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/vstudio/">VS.NET</a>, I still like Eclipse better as an IDE. And sadly, I'm not <a href="http://www.bluesnews.com/plans/1/">John Carmack</a> yet. Any day now...
