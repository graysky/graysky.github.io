Last October when I bought a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Canon-Digital-Rebel-10-1MP-Camera/dp/B000I1ZWRW">Canon Rebel XTi</a> camera I found that if I shot in RAW mode that <a href="http://picasa.google.com/">Picasa</a> (version 2.6.0) would display the images with a strange blue-purple hue. I filed a bug with Google back then, and got the standard response that the camera wasn't supported yet but they would pass it along to their development team. I had naively been assuming that if the CR2 format worked for the XT then it would work for the XTi. Clearly not the case. I haven't found a good explanation about what is different, other than the size of the image.

Now it's almost March and while they don't support it yet, there is a <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/PicasaSomethingBroken/browse_thread/thread/920060a0906ef55e">posting in their forum</a> collecting information on cameras that they don't support and certainly the Rebel XTi is a popular one. In the meantime I've been playing with a trial of <a href="http://www.adobe.com/products/photoshoplightroom/">Adobe Lightroom</a> that just <a href="http://blog.duncandavidson.com/2007/01/lightroom_10_to.html">went 1.0</a>. I'm still a finding my way around, but it seems pretty nice for what I need, but a little sluggish in parts. Currently there is a limited time price of $199 on Lightroom before going to $299 in April. Having to actually <em>pay for software</em> is almost foreign to me at this point. Like, shouldn't they just give it away for free?
