Thanks JavaBloggers for <a href="http://www.graysky.org/survey.html">filling out my software build survey</a> (and more responses would be great)! These results should help me examine relationships in build practices.

I haven't had the chance to analyize the data much yet, but have been struck by how widely-used CVS seems to be. I'm curious to see how quickly Subversion starts to eat into that segment.
