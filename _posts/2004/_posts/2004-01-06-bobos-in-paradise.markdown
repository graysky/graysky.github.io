Before break I finished David Brook's <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0684853787/mikechampion">Bobos In Paradise</a> ("Bobos" == "bourgeois bohemians"). Written in a light hearted and sardonic voice, he examines today's educated elites. <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/top/opinion/editorialsandoped/oped/columnists/davidbrooks/index.html">Brooks</a> (a Times editorialist and a liberal's conservative) starts with a great comparison of the Times wedding pages of fifty years ago and today. Then: WASPs who trumpet ancestory, Now: the resume is king. Between taking enjoyable and easy shots at Pottery Barn-shopping, latte-sipping bobos, he critiques the better and worse parts of bobo culture. Best of all in his examination of their intellectual, spiritial and business life is his frequent references to his historical sources. And it's like a handbook on what to do or avoid, depending on your feelings toward joining the "ballast in the vessel of the commonwealth."
