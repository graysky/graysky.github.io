Been reading some about requests to open-source Java from <a href="http://news.com.com/2100-1007_3-5165427.html">IBM</a> and <a href="http://www.catb.org/~esr/writings/let-java-go.html">ESR</a>. The issue seems to be less about who contributes patches and more about how it is released, licensed and promoted. Presumably something could be done to please the Linux community while not terrorifying the business world with the GPL. I'm all for it, if only to decrease the amount of Perl that's written. Though from Sun's perspective I don't see how it wouldn't make it even more difficult to sell their expensive hardware against Linux/Intel (Lin-Tel?).
