It's a great moment to be a Boston sports fan (and how often can you say that?)!! The Patriots <a href="http://www.boston.com/sports/football/patriots/">won the Superbowl</a> in the final minutes. The victory comes, once again, thanks to Adam Vinatieri's foot. Back in high flying '99, I went to a job fair at <a href="http://www.rational.com">Rational</a> and Vinatieri was there as a promotional gimic. I didn't even walk the 20 feet to get an autograph, although I wish I did now. Especially since there was no line because the nerds were more interested in talking software tools than to the football player.

I believe I was chowing down at half-time and <a href="http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/2004/football/nfl/specials/playoffs/2003/02/01/bc.fbn.superbowl.jackso.ap/index.html">missed perhaps the best part</a>. Gotta love Timberlake's statement about his accidently exposing Janet Jackson's breast: <i>"I am sorry that anyone was offended by the wardrobe malfunction during the halftime performance of the Super Bowl"</i>

I'd been speculating the special guest appearance was going to be President Bush, flying in on a jetpack, holding Osama's head in one hand. He'd land and yell "We got him!" and then jetpack off again to thunderous cheers. Cause you just know they have him in a cave somewhere waiting for the right point in the election to bring him out.

And finally, the commericals pretty much sucked all around. The only one I really liked or remembered was the <a href="http://www.apple.com/itunes/pepsi/">Pepsi/iTunes ad</a> with the kids who'd been sued for downloading music. And that says a lot, because I'm a die-hard Coke fan.
