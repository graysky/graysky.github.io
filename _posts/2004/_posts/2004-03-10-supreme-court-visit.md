Been in D.C. for a few days, and on Monday we went to hear the Supreme Court. They read two decisions (<a href="http://laws.findlaw.com/us/000/02-9410.html">Crawford v. Washington</a> and <a href="http://laws.findlaw.com/us/000/02-1541.html">Iowa v. Tovar</a>) and admitted members from the JAG corps and the Brooklyn bar to the Court. Only six of the Justices were there (Scalia was hunting perhaps?), and Justice Thomas looked very bored by the 25 minute session.

On the way out we ran across a <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A41785-2004Mar8.html">press conference about detainees being held in Guantanamo Bay</a>. Just another day in capital city.
