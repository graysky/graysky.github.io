The best quote from the <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2004/01/11/magazine/11BLOG.html">NYTimes Magazine piece "My So-Called Blog"</a>:

<blockquote>J.'s sense of private and public was filled with these kinds of contradictions: he wanted his posts to be read, and feared that people would read them, and hoped that people would read them, and didn't care if people read them.</blockquote>

Yeah.
