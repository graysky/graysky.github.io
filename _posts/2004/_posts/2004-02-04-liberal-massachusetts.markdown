E.J. Dionne has a great piece on the <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A7220-2004Feb2.html">truth about Massachusetts</a>, disputing the myth about Masschusetts liberalism. The phrase "Massachusetts Liberal" seems designed to conjure up an image of a Chomsky-reading, anti-religion, gun-hating, elitist egghead PhD. And, sure, there are some of those but they are almost all Cantabrigians. Just a small sampling of the various reality tv shows out there, which <i>always</i> feature a Bostonian, would convince you that the stereotype is (mostly) unfounded.

With our Patriots winning the Superbowl, our Senator Kerry being the presumptive Democratic nominee and our Court mandating <a href="http://news.findlaw.com/ap_stories/other/1110/2-4-2004/20040204084505_112.html">legalizing gay marriage</a>, we'll see how the rest of America feels about us Massholes. Gulp.
