As part of a grad school program I'm hoping to find kind-hearted software developers to <a href="http://www.graysky.org/survey.html">fill out a short survey on how their software is built</a>. I'm interested in examing relationships between build practices and various software technologies and characteristics of the software team. Any help would be greatly appreciated!
