Looks like <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/ac2/wp-dyn/A14192-2004Jan13?language=printer">Enron's Andrew Fastow has cut a plea agreement</a> for 10 years of jail time and his wife plead guilty to lesser charges. As a fellow <a href="http://www.tufts.edu">Tufts</a> alum (Fastow majored in Chinese and Economics in 1984), I take pride in his infamy since Tufts complains about being overlooked (the Times called him a "<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2002/02/06/business/06FAST.html">Financial Wizard</a>"!). He was even a <a href="http://www.alumniconnections.com/tufts/">good alumni</a> with his contact info online. Although I don't think you can reach him at his work phone anymore...
