NBC <a href="http://www.tivolovers.com/2007/09/10/download-nbc-premiers-before-they-air-for-free/">put a few of their new Fall shows on Amazon Unbox for free</a> ahead of their air date. (A smarter move than their <a href="http://daringfireball.net/linked/2007/august.php#fri-31-apple_nbc"> recent iTunes debacle.</a>) So I fired up the Tivo and <a href="http://amazon.com/unbox">downloaded 3 of them</a> in ... just under 16 hours! I have no idea why it took that long, considering these were <em>not the HD versions</em>. Tough to measure transfer rates, but the blue light was on for a long time. Without further ado, my two cents:

<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.nbc.com/Bionic_Woman/">Bionic Woman</a> - Not sold on it, though pilots are different than typical episodes. Thought <a href="http://imdb.com/name/nm0755267/">Katee Sackhoff</a> (Starbuck from <a href="http://imdb.com/title/tt0407362/">Battlestar Galactica</a> (<a href="http://imdb.com/name/nm0234928/">Chief Tyrol also has a cameo</a>)) was the most interesting part, and very nerd-friendly casting. The special effects seemed campy in a show that is aiming for a darker mood. 

<li><a href="http://www.nbc.com/Life/">Life</a> - I wanna like this show. <a href="http://imdb.com/name/nm0507073/">Damian Lewis</a> was great in <a href="http://imdb.com/title/tt0185906/">Band of Brothers</a> and the episode has a few solid moments. Also has the usually good <a href="http://imdb.com/name/nm0035060/">Adam Arkin</a> and <a href="http://imdb.com/name/nm0917848/">Robin Weigert</a> (Calamity Jane on <a href="http://imdb.com/title/tt0348914/">Deadwood</a>) co-star, but they didn't have much to do in the pilot. Still, I'd be surprised if this is a hit.

<li><a href="http://www.nbc.com/Chuck/">Chuck</a> - Amusing enough to give it a shot. It might upset those who went to Stanford to see Chuck working at what amounts to the <a href="http://www.geeksquad.com/">Geek Squad</a>.

</ul>
