While sweeping up around my server, I found the remnants of the previous iteration of this blog. I've been half-heartedly keeping a blog since 1998/99, most of which has thankfully been lost to the ages. I've put the remaining <a href="/archives/">trove online</a>, even though much of it is painful to read through. This should make it easier for future biographers to learn about my <a href="/2003/09/back-from-alaska/">travels</a>, <a href="/2003/09/paul-krugman-talk-harvard-square/">politics</a>, <a href="/2004/01/punch-it/">random experiences</a> and previous <a href="/2002/10/game-on/">tv watching habits</a>. I expect it will be a several volume set.
