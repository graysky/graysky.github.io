New Yorker writer <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Packer">George Packer</a> recently started a <a href="http://www.newyorker.com/online/blogs/georgepacker">writing a blog called "Interesting Times"</a>. As one of the better writers today on Iraq, it is interesting to see his more frequent thoughts in shorter form. A little funny since in 2004 <a href="http://www.motherjones.com/commentary/columns/2004/05/04_200.html">Packer declared that he hated blogs</a> (while being addicted to them).
