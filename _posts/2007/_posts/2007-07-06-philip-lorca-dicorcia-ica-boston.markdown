Yesterday we went to the <a href="http://www.icaboston.org/">Institute of Contemporary Art in Boston</a> in its impressive South Boston home (or perhaps "Fan Pier" has a better ring?) and the <a href="http://www.icaboston.org/exhibitions/exhibit/dicorcia/">photo exhibit of Philip-Lorca diCorcia</a>. The building, designed by <a href="http://www.dillerscofidio.com/">Diller Scofidio + Renfro</a>, is worth the trip (and admission is free on Thursdays). I'd been waiting for an interesting exhibit, as most contemporary art does little for me. For example, the ICA lobby has a large scale piece by Chiho Aoshima entitled <a href="http://www.icaboston.org/exhibitions/exhibit/aoshima/">"The Divine Gas"</a> featuring a giant girl with anime-proportioned eyes in a vividly colorful scene breaking wind. (Perhaps it is divine, but there are creatures falling from the sky in her wake.) The guide gave the standard contemporary art explanation of its meaning, namely take-your-pick. She suggested perhaps a commentary on environmental destruction? Or Hiroshima? I was more interested how she made it on her Apple and printed out this huge image. 

The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philip-Lorca_diCorcia">Philip-Lorca diCorcia</a> photo exhibit is a collection of his street work as well as earlier indoor shots of his friends and family. The <a href="http://www.boston.com/ae/theater_arts/articles/2007/06/01/still_lives/">Globe comments on the cinematic quality to his work</a> and the sense of confinement. The "Heads" series of 4x5 candids are stunning, including one of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nussenzweig_v._DiCorcia">Erno Nussenzweig that has been the subject of an ongoing lawsuit</a>. Also, <a href="http://www.artic.edu/aic/exhibitions/story/dicorcia.html">"Hartford" depicts an eerie interior Christmas</a> scene that makes one happy the 1970s are gone.
