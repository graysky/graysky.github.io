The movie <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0246578/">Donnie Darko</a> has been <a href="http://www.amrep.org/darko/">adapted to a play</a> and will run at the <a href="http://www.amrep.org/venues/zarrow/">Zero Arrow Theatre</a> in Cambridge starting Oct. 27th. Just in time for Halloween! I'm a big fan of the genre-askewing movie. Cool (if confusing) story, nailed the 80s feel, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donnie_Darko_(soundtrack)">perfect soundtrack</a>, solid Patrick Swayze cameo, and I still laugh when I hear "Sometimes I doubt your commitment to Sparkle Motion." I did find the <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0446819/">director's cut</a> disappointing though - it tried to explain what was better left vague. My wife scores huge points for noticing it at the <a href="http://www.amrep.org/">American Rep</a> - she knows me well. 

I'm curious how it will <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donnie_Darko#Donnie_Darko_on_the_Stage">translate to the stage</a>. In the words of Homer: "Ooh I love legitimate theater!"
