Started to <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/downtree/tags/canonefs1022mmf3545usm/">play around with a new lens</a>, the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html%3FASIN=B0002Y5WXE%26tag=mikechampion%26lcode=xm2%26cID=2025%26ccmID=165953%26location=/o/ASIN/B0002Y5WXE%253FSubscriptionId=1N9AHEAQ2F6SVD97BE02">Canon EF-S 10-22mm f/3.5-4.5 USM</a>. Definitely a wide angle. It is a little longer and heavier than I'd expected, but the USM focusing is fast and quiet. I decided on this lens after <a href="http://www.photo.net/equipment/canon/efs_10-22/">reading reviews</a> for a while on what wide angle lens to get. I convinced myself that buying an "EF-S" lens (that only works on smaller body cameras) wasn't short-sighted since I plan to use the Rebel XTi for a while. Looking forward to using the lens more, and <a href="http://www.flickr.com/groups/efs1022/">checking out</a> those who take <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pearbiter/sets/72157594203653610/">good shots</a> with it.
