Today's <a href="http://www.boston.com/business/articles/2007/04/07/getting_ready_to_teach_rock_star_101/">Boston Globe reports</a> on Paul Green's new <a href="http://www.schoolofrock.com/">School of Rock</a> that is opening in Watertown. (Fine writeup except for a sad, little "more cowbell" joke.)  They are accepting up to 180 students aged 7 to 18 to study guitar, bass, drums, keyboards, or vocals for 12 weeks. The youngsters will expand Watertown's rock numbers, joining the likes of <a href="http://www.grizzly-bear.net/">Grizzly Bear</a> who recently recorded their <a href="http://www.boston.com/ae/music/articles/2007/02/02/artists_in_residence/">latest album here</a>. For those kids about to rock <a href="http://h2otown.info/">H2otown</a>, we salute you.
