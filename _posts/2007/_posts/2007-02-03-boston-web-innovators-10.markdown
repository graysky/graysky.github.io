Having missed the last couple of Boston Web Innovators events, I was impressed when I walked into the ballroom to see such a large crowd (200+?) for the <a href="http://www.webinnovatorsgroup.com/blog/2007/02/01/webinno10-recap-and-the-next-event-march-28th/">10th meetup</a>. Great to see the expanding interest, and I was particularly pleased to see some students there. Boston obviously has a vibrant student population, but I hadn't seen many attending past events. I spent much of the evening catching up with some people I hadn't seen in a while, which was great, but the night went by so quickly that I missed the opportunity to talk to new people. Some quick thoughts on the "main dishes" of the evenings:

<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.guildcafe.com">Guild Cafe</a>. A social site for gamers' guilds and clans seems like a rare niche among social sites that actually makes a lot of sense. These are already very active communities, with people who are literally obsessed with games and their groups.

<li><a href="http://www.goombah.com/">Goombah</a>. A music recommendation service that tracks your iTunes listening and library to suggest other music and free downloads using Napster. While the service looks nice, I think it will be hard for them to get noticed above Last.fm, Pandora and iLike. 

Also, among those I talked to, the name "Goombah" seems like a poor choice. <a href="http://www.goombah.com/FAQ.html#goombah">Their site explains the name</a>, but in my mind it either reminded me of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goomba">little Super Mario Bros. enemy</a> or a slur against Italians. 
</li>

<li><a href="http://www.mypunchbowl.com/">MyPunchbowl</a>. Evite needs killing, but it will be a uphill battle for MyPunchbowl. The <a href="http://bostonwtf.com/mypunchbowl-party-planning">BostonWTF review</a> of the service does a good job of calling out their strengths and the challenges ahead of them. In the demo Matt Douglas showed some of their nice features, such as the Plaxo integration and <em>actually including</em> the party information in the generated emails. I hope they can break through to get the attention of the very broad market they are hunting.
</ul>
