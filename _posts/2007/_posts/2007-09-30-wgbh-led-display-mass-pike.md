The new <a href="http://www.wgbh.org">WGBH</a> headquarters in Brighton has a <a href="http://www.wgbh.org/picture">30x45ft. LED display visible from the eastbound Mass. Pike below.</a> During the day they run a series of digital murals, the one pictured is <a href="http://www.wgbh.org/picture/?item_id=3613757">&quot;Giraffes Don't Huff&quot;</a>, and at night an image of the evening sky. The display is part of a <a href="http://www.boston.com/ae/tv/articles/2007/09/16/new_building_reflects_wgbhs_purpose/">$85M building on Guest St.</a> designed by <a href="http://www.polshek.com/prog_wgbh.htm">Polshek Archecture Partners</a>. I really like that they added several smaller LED displays on 2 sides of the building that makes it seem more organically part of the structure.
