Sunday's Boston Globe had an article, <a href="http://www.boston.com/ae/music/articles/2007/04/08/blogosphere_of_influence/">"Blogosphere of influence"</a>, on some of the influential Boston-area music bloggers. Chief among them is the fantastic <a href="http://www.bradleysalmanac.com">Bradley's Almanac</a> that is so thorough one wonders how Brad keeps up a day job. <a href="http://www.hardcorbeau.com/">Matt Shaer's</a> article featured several other Boston area blogs, including the <a href="http://bandinbostonpodcast.com/">Band in Boston</a> and <a href="http://queenofnotes.blogspot.com/">All That She Surveys</a>. Certainly there other solid Boston-based music blogs, such as <a href="http://exitfare.blogspot.com/">Exitfare</a> and <a href="http://www.clickyclickymusic.com/">Clicky Clicky</a>.

I've very excited about the web becoming more local, and in particular about being able to follow the local music scene online. Krysta Chauncey, editor of <a href="http://queenofnotes.blogspot.com/">All That She Surveys</a>, hits the nail on the head:

<blockquote>
"National blogs are human aggregators, or litmus tests for what's catching on everywhere. Local blogs help maintain a sense of place."
