After reading this piece on Bill Gates <a href="http://www.theinquirer.net/default.aspx?article=37763">limiting the computer usage of his kids</a> and later that day seeing <a href="http://www.apple.com/iphone/hello/">Apple's latest iPhone "Hello" commercial</a>, I got to thinking about what their teenage rebellion will look like. It's inevitable that teenagers will push back against their parents, even ones as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_gates#Personal_life">rich as Bill & Melinda</a>. Will one of them throw out their Zune and come home with an iPod? Start touting how OSX had certain features before Vista? That must be healthier in the long run than if they start trying to spread tuberculosis and malaria just to spite their parents.
