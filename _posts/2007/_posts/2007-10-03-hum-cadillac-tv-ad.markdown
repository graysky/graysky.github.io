This Cadillac ad was on in the background, and I wasn't paying attention (not being a <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0413573/">Grey's fan</a>) until the last 10 seconds when a familar riff burst forth. It was "Stars" from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hum_(band)">Hum</a>! Yes, mid-90s era <a href="http://www.myspace.com/hum">Hum</a>! And I'll admit it did make <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0005532/">Kate Walsh</a> driving her Cadillac seem more rockin'.

I ask you - how the hell did Hum not end up being huge? I know I'm a sucker for <a href="http://hypem.com/artist/hum">their songs</a> (and <a href="http://elecvp.blogspot.com/2007/09/addison-montogomery-shepherd-cadillac.html">not alone</a>), but still. It is so bitter-sweet to hear the radio occasionally play their most popular single, "Stars", and I end up yelling, alone, in my car that they should play anything, <em>anything</em> off <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B000002X2I/ref=nosim?tag=mikechampion">"Downward is Heavenward"</a>. It is almost ten years old, and still feels like it is from the future. How can you not like a band that has lyrics about <a href="http://www.songmeanings.net/lyric.php?lid=14211">benzene rings</a>? Or songs like <a href="http://hypem.com/track/239493">Dreamboat</a> that are now forever lodged in my brain:

<blockquote>
You swore the earth was round
And you said that there was no upside down
I hit the starshift left, let the parallax slip
Like you showed me in the lighthouse
And I did the math and it came up 1s and 0s
</blockquote>
