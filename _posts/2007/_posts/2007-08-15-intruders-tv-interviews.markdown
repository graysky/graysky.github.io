When I first saw reference to <a href="http://us.intruders.tv/index.php?action=article&numero=99">Intruders.tv</a> hosted by someone named Bruno, it reminded me of a certain hilarious <a href="http://youtube.com/watch?v=_7aoDXwpI0Y">Sacha Baron Cohen skit</a>. Thankfully it is not like that. Instead a series of interviews with tech entrepreneurs focusing on the Boston area.

<a href="http://us.intruders.tv/index.php?action=article&numero=109">They recently interviewed Scott Kirsner</a> of the Boston Globe about differences between the Bay Area web scene and that in Boston following <a href="http://www.boston.com/business/technology/articles/2007/07/22/will_boston_ever_catch_up/">his article on the same subject</a>. Newly back in Boston, he had some smart comments comparing the West Coast to the Yankees (always a solid go-to metaphor) in that they are only vaguely aware of a rivalry existing.
