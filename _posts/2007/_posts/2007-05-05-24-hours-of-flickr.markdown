Today, May 5th, Flickr is <a href="http://blog.flickr.com/flickrblog/2007/04/its_coming_24_h.html">hosting a project</a> called "24 Hours of Flickr". The idea is to capture what happens in a single day around the world. Selections from <a href="http://www.flickr.com/groups/24flickr/">the group's photo pool</a> will be featured at Flickr events and in a book. My contribution, above, is from an afternoon walk on this beautiful day.
