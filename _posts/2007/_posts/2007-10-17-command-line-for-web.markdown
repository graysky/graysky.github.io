I saw <a href="http://www.meangene.com/google/google_internet_search.html">this humorous piece</a> (<a href="http://valleywag.com/tech/search/if-google-had-to-swallow-its-own-medicine-311310.php">via VW</a>) about what if Google had to had to design their UI for Google, changing their clean interface into a busy, link-covered, SEO-seeking eyesore. It reminded me how I haven't visited google.com in forever, preferring the <a href="http://www.mozilla.com/en-US/firefox/search.html">Firefox built-in Google search.</a> I've always been an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/About:Blank_(disambiguation)">about:blank</a> homepage sorta guy and it can't be more spartan than this -- it is just a box:

<img src='/images/ff_google.png' alt='' />

The killer feature is the <a href="http://labs.google.com/suggestfaq.html">Google Suggest automatic suggestions</a>, both from my search history and what others have searched for. After using it for a while, it makes every other search box seem fatally limited. Combined with the Google search features like on-the-fly spell checking and <a href="http://www.google.com/help/features.html#definitions">"define:" word definitions</a> and it is my command line for the web. 

The surprising benefit is how often I repeat a search from before, although it appears that <a href="http://glinden.blogspot.com/2007/07/people-often-repeat-web-searches.html">perhaps 40% of <em>all</em> searches are repeats.</a> Rather than remembering a URL or other snippet, it is simpler to store breadcrumbs in my <a href="http://www.google.com/history/">search history</a> (despite some people's <a href="http://www.google.com/searchhistory/privacyfaq.html">privacy concerns</a>). Ctrl-K plus <a href="http://www.google.com/experimental/index.html">Google's Experimental</a> search results that are <a href="http://lifehacker.com/software/google/navigate-google-search-results-via-keyboard-shortcuts-261157.php">keyboard navigable</a> is great for making the internet feel as though it exists to answer your every question. Like the classic <a href="http://www.stevenwright.com/">Steven Wright joke</a>, "I have the world's largest sea shell collection. Maybe you've seen it. I keep it scattered on beaches all over the world."
