<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/browse.html?node=332775011">Amazon Web Services is running a series of half-day events called "The Start-Up Project"</a> that is part sessions on AWS and part mixer aimed at <a href="http://aws.typepad.com/aws/2007/08/the-start-up-pr.html">startup founders and VCs</a>. They are coming to the <a href="http://www.univparkhotel.com/">Hotel@MIT</a> in Cambridge on Thursday, Sept. 27th from 2-8pm (<a href="https://www.regonline.com/builder/site/Default.aspx?eventid=150282">registration</a>). AWS held a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/browse.html?node=332245011">similar event in Seattle</a> a few months ago that had some <a href="http://marcelo.sampasite.com/brave-tech-world/e/Amazon-s-Start-up-Project-Best-e.htm">positive blog coverage</a>.
