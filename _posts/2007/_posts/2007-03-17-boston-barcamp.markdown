Today was the first day of <a href="http://www.barcampboston.org/">Boston BarCamp</a> (#2 for those counting) at <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stata_Center">MIT's Stata Center</a>. Thankfully yesterday's snow storm wasn't enough to cancel the event. There was still a healthy turnout of those who braved the icy conditions, with some coming from as far as upstate New York. A big thanks to those who coordinated everything despite the weather, making sure there were free t-shirts, caffeine and pizza for all.

Some highlights of the day, lots more <a href="http://technorati.com/search/boston+barcamp2">found online</a> and plenty of <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/tags/barcampboston2/">photos to boot</a>: 

<ul>
<li>The first session I went to was <a href="http://groovymother.com/">Rod Begbie</a> giving a primer on <a href="http://openid.net">OpenID</a> (<a href="http://static.groovymother.com/OpenIDBarCamp.pdf">slides are here</a>). This seems like a technology that has gotten some recent momentum, and I was impressed how easy it was to have my domain delegate to another party (<a href="http://www.vox.com/">Vox</a> in this case). After the good talk, <a href="http://mike-burns.com/">Mike Burns</a> mentioned they have used the <a href="http://rubyforge.org/projects/ruby-openid/">Ruby OpenID library</a> to implement OpenID for <a href="http://studentartspace.com/">Student Art Space</a>. That goes on the long list of things to do.

<li>After lunch heard Jerrad Pierce talk about <a href="http://greenmap.mit.edu/">Green Maps</a> and GIS. I enjoyed his quick explanation of how Cambridge gets its water from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fresh_Pond,_Cambridge,_Massachusetts">Fresh Pond</a>. Interesting to hear what happens before the tap is turned.

<li>The gadget that everyone seemed to <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/downtree/424574144/">want to see</a> were the white and green laptops from the <a href="http://www.laptop.org/laptop/">One Laptop Per Children (OLPC)</a> project. They run a unique combination of <a href="http://www.laptop.org/laptop/hardware/">hardware</a>, consuming little power and creating mesh networks, and <a href="http://www.laptop.org/laptop/software/specs.shtml">software</a>, including <a href="http://wiki.laptop.org/go/Squeak">Squeak</a> and only OSS applications. But it is the small size, distinctive colors and "ears" that draw stares. 

<li>Finished the first day at the "Drop Your Pants" session, giving anyone who wants to a chance to demo something they have worked on. Good range of interesting projects, from a funny to HAL-like voice recognition system on OSX to a slick-looking <a href="http://getdropbox.com/">DropBox</a>.

</ul>

Today also gave me a chance to play around with a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html%3FASIN=B000EN0K94%26tag=mikechampion%26lcode=xm2%26cID=2025%26ccmID=165953%26location=/o/ASIN/B000EN0K94%253FSubscriptionId=1N9AHEAQ2F6SVD97BE02">Canon PowerShot SD700</a> I haven't had much to use yet. Many of the Stata Center's rooms were rather dark, offering the choice of a harsh flash or dark tones. When zoomed out, it was fine at f2.8, but zooming in (at 5.5f) left the shots too dark. The <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/downtree/sets/72157600005042432/">ones that came out alright are online</a>.
