The Arcade Fire's "Neon Bible" <a href="http://www.billboard.com/bbcom/news/article_display.jsp?vnu_content_id=1003557829">is at number 2 on the Billboard charts</a> after selling 92,000 copies in it's first week. Maybe I shouldn't be suprised by this, but I am. Sure, music blogs dialed up the hype for the band of the moment (or was that 3 years ago?), the <a href="http://select.nytimes.com/search/restricted/article?res=F7061EFF355A0C778CDDAA0894DF404482">New York Times fawned over them</a>, reviews <a href="http://www.pitchforkmedia.com/article/record_review/41377/The_Arcade_Fire_Neon_Bible">are positive</a>, <a href="http://www.borowitzreport.com/archive_rpt.asp?rec=6710&srch=">leaflets were dropped</a> but still. Maybe I just didn't think their type of music would break out of indie circles. Or perhaps because I'm one of those who liked the sound on "Funeral" much more. Clearly <a href="http://polls.gawker.com/?key==kDM0MTM&voted=1">others thought this was likely</a>, with 92,000 falling in the middle of votes cast.

Although all the hype <a href="http://idolator.com/tunes/who-charted/who-charted-the-arcade-fire-is-big-but-not-quite-big-enough-244177.php">didn't stop the Notorious B.I.G.'s</a> "Greatest Hits" from taking the #1 slot, and he's not doing much touring these days.
