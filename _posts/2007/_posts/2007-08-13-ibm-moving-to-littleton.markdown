<a href="http://www.bizjournals.com/boston/stories/2007/08/13/daily9.html?jst=b_ln_hl">IBM announced they are forming a Massachusetts campus in Littleton</a> and Westford. Reportedly aiming to move 3,400 developers into the nearly 500,000 sq. ft. in addition to keeping the Cambridge and Waltham sites. IBM has grown to over 5,000 employees in Massachusetts over the last few years in part from several large acquisitions and many smaller ones. There had been previous <a href="http://phoenix.bizjournals.com/phoenix/othercities/boston/stories/2007/07/16/story4.html?b=1184558400%5E1490403">reports of IBM's interest in the former HP building</a> in the tech sector near 495 that includes Red Hat, Juniper Networks and Sonus Networks.

<b>Update:</b> <a href="http://www.boston.com/business/technology/articles/2007/08/14/ibm_to_consolidate_in_bay_state/">Boston.com has coverage of the announcement</a> with a good explanation of IBM's growth in Massachusetts.
