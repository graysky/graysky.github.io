<a href="http://community.livejournal.com/tivolovers/435562.html">Amazon and Tivo</a> have hooked up <a href="http://www.amazon.com/unbox">Amazon's Unbox service</a> to download videos directly to Tivos. They give you $15 to try it out, and the setup was trivial. Sounds like it does less than HD quality for Series3 owners based on the <a href="http://www.tivo.com/4.9.24.2.asp">Tivo FAQ</a> saying,

<blockquote>Unbox videos watched on a TiVo are of better quality than videos recorded at the Best Quality setting on a TiVo Series2â„¢ DVR.</blockquote>

Buying movies this way seems <a href="http://www.pvrblog.com/pvr/2007/03/tivo_amazon_unb.html">a bit limiting</a>  between their rules and having playback tied to a Tivo. The list of rentals are a little thin at the moment, unless you are dying to see <a href="http://www.amazon.com/K-PAX/dp/B000NW5S5C">K-PAX</a> or <a href="http://www.amazon.com/You-Me-and-Dupree/dp/B000MF87P8/">You, Me and Dupree</a>. But I'm sure the selection will in over time, and the relative speed (vs. Netflix) could make it attractive for a missed TV show or an occasional movie rental. 

<b>Update:</b> A <a href="http://www.engadget.com/2007/03/07/amazons-unbox-video-download-service-now-available-on-tivo/comments/3864835/">comment on Engadget</a> says HD is coming once they re-encode the content. Cool.
