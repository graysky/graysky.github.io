The <a href="http://www.boston.com/news/globe/magazine/articles/2007/03/25/the_hot_five/?page=full">Boston Globe ranks Watertown among the top five towns</a> for first time home buyers (with Lowell, Billerica, East Boston and Brockton). I'd like to think that despite Watertown's lack of bars it is on its way to being the next Somerville. I see plenty of hipsters lining up at the <a href="http://www.deluxetowndiner.com/">Deluxe Town Diner</a> for brunch on weekends and hope they are the shock troops of increased interest. <a href="http://h2otown.info/">H2otown</a> has plenty of <a href="http://h2otown.info/node/505">good restaurants</a>, a <a href="http://www.newrep.org/">small theater</a>, crazy l<a href="http://h2otown.info/node/1971">ocal politics</a> and convenient if less than great mall & box stores. From where we live it is faster and easier to get to Harvard/Central/Kendall Squares than it was from our previous place in North Cambridge (Mass Ave. through Porter Sq. can be excruciatingly slow). And we like our space in the <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/downtree/sets/72157594570267436/">industrial / bakery district</a> of East Watertown.
