Video of <a href="http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=973149761529535925">Merlin Mann's talk at Google about his "Inbox Zero"</a> series on controlling your email. Full of good tips extracted from his <a href="http://www.inboxzero.com">series of posts on the same subject</a>. Thankfully my professional and personal email inboxes are quite sane. At work, we use the <a href="
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lotus_Notes">Lotus Notes client</a> which, putting it mildly, <a href="http://lotusnotessucks.4t.com/index.html">I don't love using</a>. Especially when compared with Gmail which I actively enjoy. Although I wonder if Notes' annoyances are not a bug, but rather a feature? I receive an order of magnitude less than the <em>500+ daily</em> emails a Googler mentions getting in Merlin's talk. Perhaps having a tool that isn't quite as satisifying means people are slightly less likely to fire off unnecessary emails? I'll tell myself that the next time I'm waiting for Notes to replicate or swearing at the built-in search.
