Last night I hit up Boston's first <a href="http://techcocktailboston1.eventbrite.com/">TECH cocktail</a> event in the shadow of Fenway Park. <a href="http://www.yelp.com/biz/PYtT4OgCv83Ux_WPPSl7AA">Reviewers think Tequila Rain</a> is usually a Spring Break / frat party atmosphere, so last night was a <em>little bit</em> <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/tags/techcocktailboston/">of a deperature</a>. There was a <a href="http://www.innoeco.com/2007/09/bostons-first-tech-cocktail.html">good mix of different types</a> of folks, who are often identifiable by their clothes. Flocks of people in bright orange t-shirt <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/somewhatfrank/1342531772/in/set-72157601899550312/">pumping Zoominfo</a> or <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/somewhatfrank/1342528788/in/set-72157601899550312/">black shirts for Geezo</a>, business casual for VC/lawyer/consultant types, more trendy for the PR/biz-dev ilk and code monkeys often have a certain look about them. Although some hybrid types can be tough to pick out, or some web designers are better dressed than typical nerds (hairgel or shirts with a <a href="http://typography.com/fonts/font_overview.php?productLineID=100032">cool font</a> can be a clue). There was a solid turnout, but it wasn't wall to wall (and a better gender balance that at many tech events). By the end of the night my voice was sore from yelling over the music and other conversations.

I had several interesting convesations about the Boston web scene. There are a growing number of events like <a href="http://www.techcocktail.com/blog/">TECH cocktail</a> and the <a href="http://www.oreillynet.com/ignite/blog/">O'Reilly Ignite</a> (that was also last night), and <a href="http://webinno14.eventbrite.com/">WebInno on Monday</a> that bring people together. But I think there are pieces missing on the web that can help amplify the conversation and bring attention of Boston-area web startups. It is easy to whine about being overshadowed by Silicon Valley (which is a strange metaphor), but the answer is to help build a more vibrant community here. More to come soon on this, hopefully.
