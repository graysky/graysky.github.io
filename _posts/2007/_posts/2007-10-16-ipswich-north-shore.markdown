We went on a short, Fall trip to <a href="http://www.ipswichma.com/">Ipswich</a> on the north shore of Massachusetts (<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/downtree/sets/72157602445369141/">photos</a>). The two things I learned:

<ul>
<li>There is a lot to explore in my own backyard, so to speak. When I'm in another city, I'm always looking to do something new, yet when I'm home I'm rarely in "tourist mode". People travel here to see things I could anytime, but often don't. For example, <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A8595-2004Oct5.html">cider donuts</a> -- I should eat many more of them.

<li>I need to better learn how to <a href="http://www.roguepaddler.com/camcope.htm">shoot scenes with shadows and highlights</a> -- I blew out a lot of skies in photos I took. Next time I will turn on the histogram display when reviewing shots, which will even flash any overexposed regions.
</ul>
