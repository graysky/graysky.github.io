As a Red Sox fan it is difficult to avoid wallowing in schadenfreude at the <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2007/10/09/sports/baseball/09yankees.html">Yankees loss</a> -- we too often <a href="http://bostonist.com/2007/10/01/if_you_host_it.php">sink to chanting "Yankees Suck"</a> even in celebration of Sox achievements. Instead, this <a href="http://wbztv.com/video/?id=40554@wbz.dayport.com">video captures what I truly love about over-the-top Red Sox fandom</a> -- a family from my hometown who <a href="http://wbztv.com/video/?id=40554@wbz.dayport.com">re-created Fenway Park in their bathroom</a>, with more comfortable seating no less. Almost as good as living in Manny Jr.'s<sup><a href="#f1">[1]</a></sup> <a href="http://www.boston.com/news/globe/magazine/galleries/2005/0717/design/">Fenway Park-themed bedroom</a> (I wonder if in that Fenway <a href="http://www.dailymotion.com/video/x1xt73_manny-pets-tavarez_sport">Manny Sr. will also comb his hair</a> like in this classic Manny moment?).

<span class="footnote"><small><a name="f1">[1]</a></small> Among the strange but true Manny Ramirez facts is that he has <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manny_Ramirez#Personal_life"><em>two sons</em> named "Manny Jr."</a> He's an <a href="http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2007/04/23/070423fa_fact_mcgrath">interesting individual</a>.</span>
