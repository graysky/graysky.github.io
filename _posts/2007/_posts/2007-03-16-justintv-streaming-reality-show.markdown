<a href="http://yrumors.blogspot.com/2007/03/justintv-live-webcast-of-kiko-co.html">Y Rumors has a post</a> on the upcoming <a href="http://www.justin.tv/">Justin.tv</a> by the former-Kiko guys (<a href="http://www.web-strategist.com/blog/2007/02/23/videoblogger-profile-justin-tv-the-walking-reality-show/">short interview about justin.tv</a>). I'm intrigued. This seems like a natural progression, where someone <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/socialmoth/405514166/in/set-72157594561460322/">streams their whole life to the web</a>. Minus the restroom trips, hopefully. I think everyone has wondered what kind of movie (or reality show) their life would make. I know I've got my soundtrack picked out.

On a related note, this <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/socialmoth/405509951/">photo of Paul Graham dishing advice while riding a Segway</a> cracked me up.
