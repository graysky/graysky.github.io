<a href="http://www.boston.com/business/technology/articles/2007/08/10/betahouse____a_haven_for_web_entrepreneurs/?page=full">The Boston Globe has a piece on Betahouse</a> that is a shared space for web entrepreneurs. The <a href="http://www.betahouse.org/">Betahouse</a> is in Central Square and is filling up with many of the people I've been impressed meeting through <a href="http://www.webinnovatorsgroup.com/">WebInno meetups</a>. The article cites Betahouse as part of an increasing interest in the consumer web in Boston, and the scene growing to nourish it (sometimes with beer.)
