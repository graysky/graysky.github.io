I'd like to second <a href="http://jbreitling.blogspot.com/2007/03/review-andrew-bird-armchair-apocrypha.html">Mr ClickyClicky</a> on how much I like <a href="http://www.andrewbird.net">Andrew Bird's</a> new album <em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000MV9A1C/mikechampion">Armchair Apocrypha</a></em>. The mix of instrumentation and atmospherics play well together. Stand out tracks include "Fiery Crash" which almost sounds like a Wilco (or even Superchunk) song and "Imitosis" which is lyrically depressed ("it was anything but hear the voice / that says we're all basically alone") but the delivery is very catchy. Perhaps the strongest track is the 7-minute "Armchairs" where his voice climbs and the dynamics are reminiscent of Jeff Buckley.

This weekend <a href="http://www.studio360.org/episodes/2007/03/23">Andrew Bird appeared on Studio360</a> in an episode about being alone. Bird talks about moving into a barn in rural Illinois by himself to work on his music. But he's back among people again and will be playing at the <a href="http://tourb.us/show/28842-Andrew_Bird-Berklee_Performance_Center-Boston-MA">Berklee Performance Center on May 16th</a>. Tickets were getting into the thin air section when I bought mine.
