<a href="http://outside.in/blog/2007/08/02/outsidein-not-just-for-placebloggers-anymore-2/">Outside.in announced improved support for bloggers who occasionally "placeblog"</a> or write about a specific spot. Most blogs are not full-time placeblogs like <a href="http://h2otown.info/">h2otown</a>, but occasionally have localized content. I <a href="http://graysky.org/2007/04/watertown-in-top-10-bloggiest-neighborhoods/">chatted with them back in April</a>, and heard back that you could make a specific feed, submit each post individually to outside.in, or wait because they were working on it. Now they have <a href="http://outside.in/add_link/add_content.php">four ways to get posts tagged with a location</a>. I've started using a <a href="http://georss.org/geopress">WordPress plugin called GeoPress</a> to add <a href="http://georss.org/">GeoRSS tags</a> to my Atom feed which outside.in picks up. (<a href="http://intertwingly.net/blog/2007/07/25/First-Impressions">"RSS" is the new Kleenex</a>, dontchaknow.) The plugin can plot of the post on a Google/Yahoo map (once you get an API key), that you could include in your blog post.

The most interesting part of <a href="http://avc.blogs.com/a_vc/2007/08/part-time-place.html">Fred's write-up</a> was his mention of their upcoming distribution deals:

<blockquote>...it will be there in at least an hour or two and given all the distribution deals outside.in is working on, it will probably show up in a lot of other places on the web that are about the place you blog about.</blockquote>

The tools for monitoring and producing localized feeds still seems young and far behind geotagging photos. And unfortunately keyword tagging (like "cambridge") is a poor substitute (although a zipcode tag is better than nothing). What needs to come first - better tools for bloggers to create geotagged posts or <a href="http://www.edho.com/2007/07/11/kmlgeorss-on-the-iphone/">apps that demonstrate</a> the reason to do so?
