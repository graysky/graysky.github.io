SNL was rather weak, but there was a gem hidden near the end in the form of this digital short, <a href="http://youtube.com/watch?v=7LAZgcC3jgo">"Sloths"</a>. The line that sloths will "hire a dog to burn down a hospital" is hilariously random. Aside from doing most of the recent digital shorts <a href="http://www.thelonelyisland.com/">the Lonely Island guys'</a> material has a certain style to it, perhaps best captured in <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G0drL1Bbog0">Stork Patrol</a>.
