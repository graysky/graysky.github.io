Caught <a href="http://www.hbo.com/costasnow/episode/episode.13.html">"Costas Now"</a> with an episode about Barry Bonds about to break the home run record. Featured an interview an uncomfortable Bud Selig and with Curt Shilling, who is outspoken as ever. But Chris Rock <a href="http://www.racewire.org/archives/2007/07/barry_bonds_clearly_a_question_1.html">stole the show in a discussion about Bonds</a>. He ripped into Babe Ruth homeruns because he played in an era of segregation, saying the stats are bullshit:

<blockquote>"Because they didn't play against black players. It's like saying I won the New York City Marathon but no Kenyans ran that year. Babe Ruth has 714 Affirmative Action home runs."</blockquote>

He had similar <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KdiS91OguJc">comments on during a Letterman</a> appearance recently.
