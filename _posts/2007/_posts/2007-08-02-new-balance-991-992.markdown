On Sunday I made a my annual pilgrimage to the <a href="http://www.yelp.com/biz/DveVfjSqijHv33AOQhtpwg">New Balance factory store in Brighton</a>, next to their world headquarters, to pick up some new shoes. I've been rocking <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B0000UR3GY/ref=nosim/mikechampion">gray 991s</a> for a while now, popular with <a href="http://www.tuaw.com/2005/06/23/steve-jobs-as-fashion-model/">Steve Jobs</a> and lesser nerds everywhere. (I can't believe that <a href="http://www.stevesoutfit.com/">Jobs' outfit</a> including <a href="http://valleywag.com/tech/steve-jobs/how-long-has-steve-jobs-worn-nikes-176090.php">Nikes was anything but a PR move</a>.) New Balance markets them as running shoes, but I've found they work perfectly well for swaddling feet while sitting in front of a computer too. 

I was surprised to find that the 991s have been retired in favor of the <a href="http://www.newbalance.com/running/training/M992/">992s</a>. Why mess with perfection? Does <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michelangelo's_David">The David</a> need to be improved? That is, if The David was a shoe made for the <a href="http://www.newbalance.com/corporate/pressroom/2005/10/product_2005_10_13_168.php">"the mild to moderate overpronator"</a>. Thankfully the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B000GBJQKS/ref=nosim/mikechampion">new 992s</a> seem very similar and my old pair of 991s are nearly indestrucible.
