RCN had an internet outage late last week. They get a half point for having a <a href="http://status.rcn.com/index.cgi?qtype=readpost&postid=4214">status page</a>, even though the dates were wrong and (of course) there was no internet to check it on. Is it not possible for them to send an email/SMS heads up <em>before</em> scheduled outages? Also, found that my Motorola Surfboard cable modem has a handy "standby" button that is easily pressed to accidently extend the hellishness that is being disconnected from the internet.
