Last night the Red Sox won an exciting 13-10 game over the Blues Jays. <a href="http://www.boston.com/sports/baseball/redsox/articles/2007/09/04/pitching_takes_a_holiday_in_win/">Dice-K had pitched 5 strong innings before a terrible 6th inning</a> when the Blue Jays came within one run after leading 10-1. Both teams ended the night with 16 hits. <a href="http://www.boston.com/sports/baseball/redsox/articles/2007/09/04/lowell_on_major_roll/">Mike Lowell was on fire</a> with a 3-run blast and a great play at third to stop a run scoring (topped only by Jacoby Ellsbury's fantastic run-saving diving catch in left field). Combined with the Yankees loss to the Mariners, the <a href="http://pudge.net/magic/">"magic number" is now 18.</a> Great way to spend Labor Day evening. <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/downtree/sets/72157601846419420/">More photos here</a>.
