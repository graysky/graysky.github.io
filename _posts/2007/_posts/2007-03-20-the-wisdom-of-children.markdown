Most of the time the New Yorker humor is a little too dry for my taste, but sometimes they let in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jack_Handey">Jack Handey</a> pieces or ones like this, <a href="http://www.newyorker.com/humor/2007/03/26/070326sh_shouts_rich">"The Wisdom of Children"</a>, that are actually funny.

<blockquote>
<b>How College Kids Imagine the United States Government</b>

THE NINETEEN-SIXTIES

—Mr. President! Did you hear about Woodstock?
—Woo— Woodstock? What in God’s name is that?
—Apparently, young people hate the war so much they’re willing to participate in a musical sex festival as a protest against it.
—Oh, my God. They must really be serious about this whole thing.
—That’s not all. Some of them are threatening to join communes: places where they make their own clothing . . . and beat on drums.
—Stop the war.
—But, Mr. President!
—Stop all American wars!
—(sighs) Very well, sir. I’ll go tell the generals.
—Wow. It’s a good thing those kids decided to go hear music.
