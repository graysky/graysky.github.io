The <a href="http://barcamp.pbwiki.com/BarCampBoston2">2nd Boston BarCamp</a> (properly pronounced BAH-camp) is just about <a href="http://upcoming.org/event/147080/">one month away</a>. It will be on Saturday March 17th and Sunday 18th and being held the quirky <a href="http://flickr.com/search/?q=stata%20center&w=all">Stata Center at MIT</a>. Coincidently that is also St. Patrick's Day weekend, a popular event in Boston, so we'll see if that impairs activities on Sunday morning. 

The first <a href="http://barcamp.pbwiki.com/BarCampBoston">BarCamp Boston</a> last June was a well run unconference, and <a href="http://tech.groups.yahoo.com/group/barcampboston/">planning is ongoing to make this one just as successful</a>. For those who haven't attended one before a BarCamp is,

<blockquote>
an ad-hoc gathering born from the desire for people to share and learn in an open environment. It is an intense event with discussions, demos, and interaction from participants.</blockquote>
