My already infrequent posts have been even less frequent recently. Real life has a way of intruding. After getting hitched we took an almost two week trip to Hawaii, spending time on Oahu and the Big Island of Hawaii (<a href="http://flickr.com/photos/downtree/sets/72157600320184883/">photos from the trip</a>). Of all the great things that happened, I had thoughts on some of the least important parts:

<ul>
<li>On this trip I finally stopped apologizing to myself for wanting to always be connected. I brought a laptop to download & edit photos as we traveled around. And it was incredibly convenient (except for the battery dying right before we left.) I trust <a href="http://www.yelp.com">Yelp</a> and <a href="http://www.tripadvisor.com">TripAdvisor</a> more than guidebooks to find restaurants and things to see. Checking hours of operation, consulting a map, etc. was all very useful. And it was the only real source of news, as CNN seemed focused on Paris Hilton.

<li>I was torn on what photo gear to bring with me. There is a difficult balance in finding the set of things I'm willing to lug around vs. what I'll want when actually taking photos. Most of it was outdoors and in day light, so that helps limit it. Maybe the question of what lenses to bring would be easier if I had a telephoto zoom that I liked, but that has other drawbacks. Instead I decided to constrain myself to shooting with a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B0007U0GZM/ref=nosim?tag=mikechampion">Sigma 30mm f/1.4</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B0002Y5WXE/ref=nosim?tag=mikechampion">Canon EF-S 10-22mm</a> (great for all scenic landscapes) and PowerShot P&S for when I didn't want to carry anything. The <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/downtree/sets/72157600320184883/">results can be viewed on flickr</a>.

<li>The jetlag going from Boston to Honolulu was negligible despite the 12 hours flying and 6 hour time change. We arrived tired from the many hours of traveling, and settled in to an early-to-bed, early-to-rise schedule perfect for tourists. Coming back east was a <a href="http://www.gi.alaska.edu/ScienceForum/ASF12/1261.html">different story</a>. Several days of feeling out of sorts and being up far too late (even for me). While up late I've read articles about <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jet_lag">ways to prevent jetlag</a> related to disruption of circadian rhythms. And here I thought it meant traveling back in time is easier than into the future.

</ul>
