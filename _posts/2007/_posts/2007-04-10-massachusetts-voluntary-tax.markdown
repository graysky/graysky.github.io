While finishing my tax return TurboTax asked me if I would like to pay Massachusetts' <em>voluntary increased</em> tax rate of 5.85%. It was hard to click on the "No, Thanks" because of all my laughing.  As their hint said:

<blockquote>
This tax rate is strictly voluntary and will increase your tax. Most people answer "No" here.
</blockquote>

I wonder if they get many takers? The question doesn't even offer that the money will be used for some noble cause, just higher taxes. Now, if they said you no longer had to obey traffic laws I might be game.
