<a href="http://www.radiolab.org">WNYC's Radio Lab</a> is a recent addition to my podcast subscriptions (<a href="http://highlynontrivial.com">via</a>). Interesting subjects, and far more stylized than most public radio programs. Joins <a href="http://www.onpointradio.org/">OnPoint</a>, <a href="http://thislife.org/">This American Life</a>, and <a href="http://www.kcrw.com/etc/programs/tt">The Treatment</a> as entertainment while driving. I've found a dearth of good tech podcasts that I can listen to consistently. I've been liking <a href="http://rss.gigavox.com/series/innovators.xml">Jon Udell's Interviews with Innovators</a>, some <a href="http://www.itconversations.com">IT Conversations</a>, and occasional <a href="http://www.se-radio.net/">Software Eng. Radio</a> or <a href="http://podcast.rubyonrails.org/">RoR podcasts</a>. What I want is a <a href="http://glinden.blogspot.com/">Geeking With Greg</a> in audio form. But, like, not just a reading of all the tech papers he links to, more of a condensed, CliffNotes version.
