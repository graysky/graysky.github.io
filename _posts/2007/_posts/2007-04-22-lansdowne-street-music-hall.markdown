The Boston Globe has a piece on the proposal by owner <a href="http://www.boston.com/news/local/articles/2007/04/21/club_owner_has_new_vision_for_lansdowne_st/">Patrick Lyons to transform Avalon and Axis into a "modern entertainment complex"</a>. Lansdowne Street, in the shadow of Fenway Park's <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Green_Monster">Green Monster</a>, has been home to a lot of great music over the years and the facelift looks to include popular and fine dining in addition to performance space. I can't disagree that the area has always felt a little desolate with a lack of parking and few places to eat (without walking into Kenmore or to the otherside of Fenway), and this is part of an effort to make the Fenway area more like <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lakeview,_Chicago#Wrigleyville">Wrigleyville</a> in Chicago. The new establishment, tentatively called "Lansdowne Street Music Hall", would hold 2,500 people compared to Avalon's 2,100 and Axis' 1,100 capacity today.

<b>1/29/08 Update:</b> The <a href="http://www.boston.com/business/articles/2008/01/29/house_of_blues_hits_lansdowne/">Lansdowne Street Music Hall has been sold to the House of Blues</a>. Patrick Lyons, who is selling the Lansdowne clubs, had co-founded the first House of Blues club in 1992 in Harvard Square.
