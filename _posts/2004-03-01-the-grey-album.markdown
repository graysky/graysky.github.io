I've been listening to the <a href="http://www.greytuesday.org">Grey Album</a>, a mix of Jay-Z's "Black Album" and the Beatle's "White Album" by DJ Danger Mouse. Who would have guessed? It works, and "99 Problems" rocks. This goes on the shelf (or the iPod equivalent) next to sample-rich Paul's Boutique.
