In the past couple weeks while avoiding the annoying WBUR fundraising there hasn't been a time when I haven't found <a href="http://www.bassdrop.com/wuwei/heyya.mp3">Outkast's "Hey Ya"</a> playing. It's everywhere - on hip hop stations, rock stations, tv, before movies and now permanently stuck in my head.
