<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2007/08/07/opinion/07ferris.html">The Times has an Op-Ed today by Joshua Ferris on the joys of Ping-Pong.</a> I second his notion (and find it funny that the Times ran a Ping-Pong-based Op-Ed), although I'd like to think I'm not as bad an athlete as the author describes himself. As Ferris writes:

<blockquote>Ping-Pong suits me nicely because of the soft paddles and relatively harmless ball. Two people locked in fierce, low-aerobic struggle. Itâ€™s perfect.</blockquote>

We have a standing <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Table_tennis">table tennis</a> game at the office at 5pm most days that's a great break from staring at a monitor. And so far, no injuries other than a hole put in a wall accidently. Before I started playing with co-workers, I hadn't played in forever. Now <a href="http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/multimedia/photo_gallery/0707/ping.pong/content.1.html">my skills have improved</a> and my <a href="http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/multimedia/photo_gallery/0707/ping.pong/content.7.html">opponents look like this as I wail on them</a>. Ok, that's not true, but it is good, clean fun (no steroid testing yet in the office league). 

The author mentions a program back in 2000 that put ping-pong tables around Chicago. Wish Boston would try that despite the less-than-stellar results he describes. Perhaps the new <a href="http://www.ballsoffury.com">Balls of Fury</a> movie (<a href="http://www.apple.com/trailers/rogue_pictures/ballsoffury/">trailer</a>) will spark newfound interest, but I doubt it. The movie doesn't look great, other than perhaps <a href="http://imdb.com/gallery/ss/0424823/Ss/0424823/04196R.jpg.html?path=gallery&path_key=0424823">Christopher Walken</a> doing his Christopher Walken thing.
