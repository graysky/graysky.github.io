<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2007/08/05/technology/05rich.html">The NYTimes writes about the Silicon Valley minor millionaires who don't feel rich.</a> It is <a href="http://www.scripting.com/stories/2007/08/04/theAngstOfSiliconValley.html">easy to attack</a> these poor people who have to survive with only a few million in the bank while living in the shadow of their more tony neighbors in Atherton. A charitable reading of the piece would be a <a href="http://www.nber.org/papers/w10667">confirmation of the findings</a> that one's peers relative status heavily influences happiness even if the standard of living is very high in absolute terms. Still, it hardly stirs one's sympathies. The refreshing part of the article is the admission that well off people are still working 70 hour weeks in the Valley's "sprawling post-war suburb" for the money, and not some altruistic desire to to revolutionize the world by creating another social network.
