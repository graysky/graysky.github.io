Some friends <a href=" http://www.startribune.com/opinion/commentary/19189879.html?location_refer=Editorials">recently published an op-ed describing</a> why they, a straight couple, chose to travel to Canada, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Same-sex_marriage_in_Canada">which supports gay marriage</a>, rather than marry in their state of Minnesota. This was right before California legalized gay marriage as well, but heading to Thunder Bay makes it seem like more of a sacrifice than San Francisco.
