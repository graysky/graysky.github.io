The other night at dinner I was reminded of a classic <a href="http://www.kithfan.org/">Kids in the Hall</a> bit called <a href="http://youtube.com/watch?v=epa5YZIJU8I">"Girl Drink Drunk"</a>.

<div class="video-frame">
<object width="425" height="355"><param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/epa5YZIJU8I&rel=1"></param><param name="wmode" value="transparent"></param><embed src="http://www.youtube.com/v/epa5YZIJU8I&rel=1" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" wmode="transparent" width="425" height="355"></embed></object>
</div>

It's one of my favorites along with the <a href="http://www.spike.com/video/2767708/subchannel/tvclips?sublisting=&sort=&&relatedPage=3&numPerPage=10">"French Trappers"</a>, and other great bits like <a href="http://youtube.com/watch?v=g8f23IRy554">"The Eradicator"</a> and <a href="http://youtube.com/watch?v=On6FSphbpUY">"Never Put Salt in Your Eyes"</a>.

While I still think those late 80s/early 90s Canadians were damn funny, and were part of the comedy pantheon that I constantly quoted with my friends, the timing comes off as somewhat slow. Not 7-minute-SNL-sketch slow, but still slower than the pace set by shows like "Arrested Development" or "30 Rock". <a href="http://www.stevenberlinjohnson.com/">Steven Johnson's</a> book <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1573223077/mikechampion"><i>Everything Bad is Good for You</i></a> pointed out that the increased pace and more complicated plot lines of modern tv makes shows from 20 years ago almost unwatchable now.
