<a href="http://www.kottke.org/remainder/08/06/15892.html">Via kottke</a> a pointer to a piece from last summer by <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2007/08/26/magazine/26neworleans-t.html">Michael Lewis about catastrophe bonds</a> and the insurance industry before and after Katrina. Another interesting example about the difficulty in estimating and pricing very rare events, like <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_swan_theory">black swans</a>. Having liked both <em>Moneyball</em> and <em>The Blindside</em>, his upcoming book on the rebuilding of New Orleans should be worth reading.
