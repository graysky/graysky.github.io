Following last week's blackout, this <a href="http://powerworld.tech.com/Java/Eastern/">applet that let's you watch power flow around the Eastern region</a> is pretty interesting. Shows which areas the power comes from and where it goes. I'd wondered where the transmission lines that run above my gym went - mostly when it was snowing and raining and you hear the hissing from it hitting the lines.

And I know they are saying it started a <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2003/08/18/national/18GRID.html">problem in the MidWest</a>, but I still have a gut instinct to <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=%22blame+canada%22">blame Canada</a>.
