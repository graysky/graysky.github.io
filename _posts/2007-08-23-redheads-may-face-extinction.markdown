<a href="http://www.news.com.au/couriermail/story/0,23739,22289891-23272,00.html">Redheads may go extinct by 2060 according to an article citing National Geographic.</a> As a member of this endangered minority, this would be alarming if I believed it. I hope to be alive in 2060, or at least my soul in a vast computer network. And just looking at the comments on the <a href="http://reddit.com/info/2hw8v/comments">Reddit thread show that at least nerdy guys like redheaded women.</a> The best quote from the article is, 

<blockquote>
"National Geographic says the gene at first had the beneficial effect of increasing the body's ability to make vitamin D from sunlight. However, today's carriers are more prone to skin cancer and have a higher sensitivity to heat and cold-related pain."</blockquote>

Less rickets, more cancer & pain. Great trade-off, thanks Nature. Realizing that I'm a mutant of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MC1R">Mc1r gene</a> led me to some <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_hair">reading up on our condition, culture and challenges</a>. Wikipedia is fantastic for including Conan along with Shakespeare, Churchill and Jefferson as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_hair#Positive_attitudes_towards_redheads">famous redheads</a> and detailing all the comic book and sci-fi redheads.

I'd never heard the term "ginger" before the classic <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ginger_Kids">South Park episode "Ginger Kids"</a> where Cartman first argues that they <a href="http://youtube.com/watch?v=HGjRmWW6rY0">should all be destroyed</a>, and then after being tricked into thinking he is a "ginger", he argues that they are the chosen people. (Tough to disagree with Cartman that <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carrot_Top">Carrot Top</a> should be killed.) Apparently there is more <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/magazine/6725653.stm">anti-"ginger" sentiment in the U.K. than the States</a>. That kind of treatment makes my fiery temper boil! If you thought that <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_hair#Beliefs_about_temperament">crude stereotype</a> was funny, then you sir, are a bigot.
