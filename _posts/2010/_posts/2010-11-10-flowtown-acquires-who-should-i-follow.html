I'm pleased to share that <a href="http://flowtown.com">Flowtown</a> has acquired the technology behind <a href="http://whoshouldifollow.com">WhoShouldiFollow</a>, a Twitter friend 
recommendation engine that my friend and I created. Flowtown is a social marketing platform aimed at helping businesses engage with their customers. What is particularly exciting
to me is that the WSIF engine can help Flowtown deliver <strong>actionable intelligence</strong> for how businesses can expand their network to find new potential customers. Thanks to <a href="http://ethanbloch.com/">Ethan Bloch</a> and <a href="http://www.danmartell.com/">Dan Martell</a> <a href="#danmartell"><small><sup>[1]</sup></small></a> of Flowtown, both masters of the startup hustle (and blog infographic) who have been great to work with during this process!
</p>

<p>My friend <a href="http://twitter.com/gary">Gary Elliott</a> and I originally built WhoShouldiFollow<a href="#whom"><small><sup>[2]</sup></small></a> <a href="/2008/04/whoshouldifollow-twitter/">back in early 2008</a> as a way to make Twitter more useful, and as an opportunity to experiment with collaborative filters. 
</p>

Notes:

- both on twitter since mid-2006
- real-time recommendations
