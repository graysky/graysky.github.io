<a href="http://fakesteve.blogspot.com/2008/01/oxymoron-of-week.html">Fake Steve's post on IBM's most influential and Lotus Notes on the iPhone</a> is painfully funny.

<blockquote>Have you ever seen Notes? It's not software, it's a form of punishment. Companies that use Notes have to staff not only a help desk but also a suicide prevention center -- it's that bad. Even the poor bastards at IBM, who are forced to use it, do nothing but complain.
</blockquote>

And his ripping on the live-blogging from LotusSphere was amusingly savage. Sometimes I think big companies should forget about trying to be hip or cool but instead tout the serious products they build and how they make, in the words of a salesman I heard, <a href="http://www.ibm.com/investor/4q07/4q07earnings.phtml">"adult money"</a>.
