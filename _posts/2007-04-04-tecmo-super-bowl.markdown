<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tecmo_Super_Bowl">Tecmo Super Bowl</a>, perhaps the greatest football video game ever created, <a href="http://nintendo8.com/game/321/tecmo_super_bowl/">has returned as a Java applet</a> in full emulated 8-bit NES glory. I need to be very careful because although I haven't played in years, this is like giving pure heroin to a former addict. I'm very tempted to recreate the magic of Joe Montana, Jerry Rice and my beloved 49ers, but if I do I'm sure I won't get anything done for days. Weeks, even.
