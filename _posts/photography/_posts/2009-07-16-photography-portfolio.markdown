In addition to photos that I (occasionally) <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/downtree">post to Flickr</a> the other night I put together a <a href="http://graysky.org/photography/">portfolio collection</a> of photos that I like for one reason or another at <a href="http://graysky.org/photography/">graysky.org/photography</a>.

The page is built with <a href="http://devkick.com/lab/galleria/">Galleria</a>, a slick JavaScript image gallery plugin written for <a href="http://jquery.com/">jQuery</a>. I started with one of the demo examples and hacked it into a design I liked. The plugin appears to be frozen to an older version of jQuery, but I preferred its style over <a href="http://blueprintds.com/2009/01/20/top-14-jquery-photo-slideshow-gallery-plugins/">the many alternatives</a>. I wanted to have a set with more flexible sorting options that Flickr's sets allow and a simple presentation (without requiring Flash).
