I've been enjoying <a href="http://www.shorpy.com">Shorpy</a>, the "100-year-old photo blog" and this one in particular entitled <a href="http://www.shorpy.com/computing-division">"Computing Division"</a>. Pictured are long rows of women working in the Treasury Department's Computing Division typing on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burroughs_Corporation">Burroughs adding machines</a>. No offices, no air conditioning, formal clothes, no blogs, and no free soda (I'm just guessing). Good to remember next time Eclipse is a little slow and the <a href="http://www.peets.com/">Peet's coffee</a> pot is empty.
