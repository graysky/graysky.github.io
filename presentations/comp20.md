### Ming suggestions

The class has a few freshman and mostly sophomores and juniors.  Not only is there a mix of majors and non-majors, but there is also a number of students (juniors and seniors) who started Computer Science really late --very common as of recent.  I say talk no more than 40 minutes.  Topics of discussion should be (1) skills that you _absolutely_ need to have in order to succeed (e.g., communications, use revision control), (2) the technical interview process, (3) how to grow professionally, and (4) life at HubSpot including recruiting.  I'm sure there will be lots of good questions (this class asks phenomenal questions) and I won't be surprised if someone will ask about side projects.

The class is in Barnum Hall, Room 8.  Let's say I meet you in the Dowling Garage at 11:30 - 11:45 AM the day that you come, the 12th.
